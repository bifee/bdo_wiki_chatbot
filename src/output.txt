Season Characters? Season Servers?

The season servers are special servers that focus on character progression so that even new Adventurers can adapt quickly to Black Desert’s world.During a “season”, you can access that season’s servers with a “season character” you have created.Your season character can be used not only in season servers but normal servers as well. Your season character will be converted into a normal character after “graduating” from the season, or automatically when that season’s servers close at the end of the season. After this happens, you can continue playing with your converted season character like any other normally created character, keeping the level and equipment obtained.
◈ Server Selection
When you log into Black Desert, you’ll see the Server Selection screen.It doesn’t matter which server you select, as barring season servers, you can freely switch between servers and access all your characters in Black Desert. However, it is recommended for new Adventurers to use the Season-1 (Novice only) server, which provides a variety of benefits for your progression.



Connect to the Season1 (Novice only) server on the very top.


◈ Season Character Creation
After you select a server, you can create a character. Select an empty slot on the right, then press the “Create Season Character” button.


It is very important that your first character is a season character.


◈ Class Selection
In the next step, you have to decide which class to begin your adventure with.  Before you select a class, refer to each of the videos for each class’ main weapon and awakening weapon from the screen.
Looking into the details on the Class Introduction page and class introductions on the Adventurer’s Guide on the official website may provide additional helpful information.  Additionally, your season character will be able to use an item called “Fughar’s Timepiece” once. This item is used to copy your current character’s level and Skill EXP over to another character.  By doing so, this function allows you to easily experience the gameplay another class offers without having to stop experiencing the seasonal content.



Select a class of your preference, as each class has its own unique appeal.


◈ Customization
After selecting a class, you can start customizing the character. You can customize the details of its face type, hairstyle, body shape, and a variety of other features. You should take the time to customize your appearance exactly to your liking, since you can only change it via Appearance Coupons and Value Packs, which are most of the time only obtainable via the Pearl Shop.Press the Beauty Album (button shown in the picture below) on the bottom of the screen to check out the works of other Adventurers who are skilled at customizing, and apply their designs to your character right away.
Have you completed customization? Now, enter a name for your character and check the Create Season Character box, then press the Create Season Character button.




◈ The Start of an Adventure
Once you start the game after you finish creating your character, a cutscene like the one shown below will mark the beginning of your adventure.




◈ Starting Point Selection
After a series of cutscenes and tutorials, the screen where you choose between one of the two main crossroads questlines, either the Ancient Stone Chamber questline or the Mountain of Eternal Winter questline, will be displayed.  If you are an Adventurer playing Black Desert for the first time, it is recommended that you start at the Ancient Stone Chamber to experience the full storyline, and for faster progression.   With another character, if you select the Mountain of Eternal Winter questline, you’ll begin your adventure in a recently added territory of Black Desert’s world and go through a more story-driven experience.




◈ Progress via the Main Questline
The first goal to keep in mind for fast progression after stepping into the world of Black Desert with a Lv. 1 character is the completion of the Reliving the Darkness segment of the Mediah main questline, ending with the quest Apocalyptic Prophecy.

As you complete main quests, you’ll be able to obtain weapons and enhancement materials required for your character’s progression. You can also quickly reach the mid-50's in level with ease. When you are confused about which quests are the main quests, press the “O” hotkey to open up the Quests window and check the currently active quest on the “Main” tab.

Check out the Main tab and continue your adventure in order. (You can change the Quest Type at the bottom of the screen once you reach Lv. 20.)

You must focus on enhancing your gear (equipment) to defeat enemies that grow increasingly stronger as you progress. A good initial goal would be to enhance the Naru gear you obtain from the main questline step-by-step and up to its final enhancement level, PEN (V). For more details, refer to the gear guides.



◈ After the Mediah Main Questline – Succession & Awakening
Once you complete the Apocalyptic Prophecy quest, your level will likely be in the early to mid-50s.Once this is done, you should then aim for reaching Lv. 56, at which time you can proceed with the Succession and Awakening quests for your character.

(Please take note that areas in western Valencia, such as Desert Naga Temple, are monster zones that’ll help you reach Lv. 56)  Open the World Map (hotkey: M) screen or check the Monster Zone Info window from the game’s main menu (hotkey: ESC) to view other monster zones with recommended AP ranges that are either similar to or slightly lower than your current AP. It is recommended for you to have DP stats that equal around 1.2 to 1.4 times the zone’s recommended AP.

For example, the currently recommended AP for Polly’s Forest is 160+, while the recommended DP is 250+.
Once you’ve reached Lv. 56, talk to the Black Spirit to accept the Awakening & Succession questlines.  After completing the Awakening questline, you can continue with the Succession questline. Keep in mind that, depending on the class, the order in which you tackle these, and their very appearance, may vary. Once you’ve completed both the Awakening and Succession questlines, you can select one of the two fighting styles and continue your adventure.

Awakening & Succession

For most classes in Black Desert, you can select the combat type through Awakening and Succession.


Upon selecting Awakening, your character will use its awakening weapon and learn unique skills that are new and more powerful for a different type of combat.
On the other hand, if you select Succession, the current combat type and skill type will be maintained. However, you can learn higher level skills versions of skills and become more powerful just like as in Awakening.

It is recommended to equip both your main weapon and awakening weapon regardless of whether you select Awakening or Succession. However, the damage applied against enemies will come more from your awakening weapon in Awakening, and more from your main weapon in Succession.
◈ Reaching Lv. 61
Once you’ve completed Succession and Awakening, set your final season goal to be reaching Lv. 61.  There is no max level limit in Black Desert, but your combat strength depends more heavily upon your gear than your level, which is why it is recommended that you defeat monsters in monster zones appropriate for your current gear or enjoy a variety of other content once you reach Lv. 61.

There are three major ways to reach Lv. 61.

The first is leveling by defeating monsters, which is the most basic way. Level up quickly after checking out the various buffs that boost your combat strength and EXPs from the section on defeating monsters in the guide mentioned in the "Progress via the Main Questline” section of this guide.   The second way is known as the “Chenga Run.” The Chenga Run refers to leveling up quickly with the EXP you obtain from completing the quests of a certain territory from Lv. 59 to Lv. 61. You can normally reach Lv. 61 more quickly this way than from defeating monsters. Please refer to the guides posted by our Adventurers for more details on the Chenga Run. (Prior preparations ㅣKamasylvia region ㅣDrieghan region ㅣ Northwestern Calpheon region)  The third way is leveling up via the main questlines. Black Desert’s main questlines continue on to the Valencia, Kamasylvia, Drieghan, O'dyllita, and Mountain of Eternal Winter territories after you complete Mediah’s quests. Although this may be the best way to experience interesting storylines within the world, it can be a longer and tougher process in comparison to the prior two methods in regards to the rate at which you level up and level of difficulty.
◈ Reaching Lv. 61
You should complete the challenges on the season pass and enhance your Tuvala gear up to PEN (V) with your season character.

If any classes other than your current class catch your eye, try using Fughar’s Timepiece. You can copy over your current character’s combat and skill EXP to another character, and as a result, you'll have two Lv. 61 characters.

Please refer to the guides on enhancing your gear for more details on how to improve your gear beyond PEN (V) Tuvala. At this point, we would also like to recommend checking out another appealing aspect of Black Desert: life skills.

► Please check the [Gearing Guide] and [Life Skills Overview] pages for more information.

Subtópico: Beginner Guide (Part 2)
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
This is a guide meant for beginner Adventurers who have just begun their journey in Black Desert’s world.It is important to check your class skills and the game’s basic information before you start your adventure. Take a look at the varied know-how prepared here for a safe and comfortable adventure.Blind adventure without preparation is fun, but it will be more interesting if you know the basics.



You can find information about your character and its family in the character profile, the window called My Information. Please press the 'P' key to access it. You can check your current character’s personal statistics, like its health, karma, or skill points, as well as both its detailed combat and life skill figures.
​​​​​​

▲ You can check out all this data in the My Information (hotkey: P) window.
Ability • Attack Speed: Increases the physical attack speed. (Warrior, Hashashin, Ranger, Guardian, Drakania, Corsair, Lahn, Berserker, Tamer, Shai, Striker, Musa, Maehwa, Mystic, Kunoichi, Ninja, Dark Knight, and Archer)
• Casting Speed: Increases the casting speed of skills. (Sage, Sorceress, Nova, Valkyrie, Witch, Wizard, Woosa, and Maegu)
• Movement Speed: Increases the character's default movement speed.
• Critical Hit: Increases the chance of carrying out a critical strike when an attack is successful.
• Fishing: It reduces the time taken up until a fish bites.
• Gathering: Reduces all collection time when gathering.
• Luck: Increases the item drop rate for your character. Note that these abilities can be boosted by the unique effects of equipment items, and also temporarily through consuming food and elixirs.
Fitness • Breath: You can obtain Breath EXP by just running around without using mounts. When your breath level goes up, your character’s maximum stamina increases.
• Strength: Traveling with trade packs will help increase your strength level. When increasing its level, you will obtain further weight limit capacity, allowing you to carry more items on you.
• Health: Eating dishes will give you Health EXP. Increasing its level will improve your maximum character health points.
Skills that require level 55 or below will automatically be learned without any skill point cost. However, skills and passives that provide additional effects to these already learned skills cost skill points.The total skill point cost for learning all Succession or Awakening skills is around 1,000 points. For a character under level 56, you can invest skill points and then retrieve them through the ‘Reset All’ button in the top right if you don’t like how they ended up.


An important facet of Black Desert’s skills is that most of them are based on key commands input rather than using quick slots. When you put your mouse cursor above each skill on the skill window, the command to carry them out appears on the displayed tooltip. They’re displayed in the following format. Examples: [SHIFT + LMB], [LMB + RMB]. For your adventures, it is good to start practicing using the key commands, even if they initially feel complicated. You can get used to it soon enough, and it will greatly improve the flow of combat.

◈ How to chat?
You can change the chat type by activating the chat window with the "Enter" key.

• General Chat: Alt+1• Server Chat: Alt+2• Whisper: Alt+3• Party Chat: Alt+4• Guild Chat: Alt+5• World Chat: Alt+6• Group Chat: Alt+7• Roleplay Chat: Alt+8• Arsha Chat: Alt+9 General Chat is only delivered to the other Adventurers around you.Server Chat messages are sent to all Adventurers in the same server group (Balenos 1-3).But if you use the server chat, it consumes 1 energy per message sent.It is useful when you have a quick question, or when you hang out with friends. When you whisper, you must enter the target character's or family’s name in the rightmost column of the chat window. You can use the party chat only during when you’re in a party, and you need to be in a guild to use the guild chat.World Chat messages are sent to all Adventurers who are in Black Desert’s world, and are only available if you have purchased an item for it with loyalties at the Pearl Shop.The battlefield group chat is only for Adventurers involved in a battlefield, such as the Red Battlefield.

➤ Please check the [Chat Window] page for more details regarding this feature.


◈ I only want to see the chats I want
Most of the chat windows are active at first. Therefore, it may be somewhat dizzying from a beginner’s point of view. It is possible to set them according to your preferred style through the chat window settings.If you press the Ctrl key and hover your cursor over the chat window, you will see a gear icon near the chat window. You can customize the chat window by pressing this button. In the View Chat section, you can select the type of chat that you want to see by checking or unchecking each one, and you can change their color as well.To add a chat window, use the + icon on the right side of the gear. Added chat windows are available in UI edit mode (Esc → Edit UI).




◈ I want to set the game screen as I want
Black Desert’s interface can be edited via the Edit UI feature.



You can enter the interface edit mode from the main menu (hotkey: Esc).

➤ You can read more about editing the game’s UI in the [Interface] page.


◈ Quests
Quests received through the Black Spirit or NPCs are displayed on the tracker on the right of the screen.It is possible to display only the desired quests through the quest settings window, and it is also possible to arrange them by preference of type and location. The important thing for you now is to know you can choose the type of quest via the settings window and the main Quest window. Do you want to only see combat quests, or perhaps fishing quests? It can be set up there.

While for new Adventurers it is recommended to only check combat quests as to not be overwhelmed by the many NPC requests available, if at any point you become stuck unable to continue a questline, make sure to toggle on all the types of quests.




◈ There are too many quests. Do I have to do all of them?
Quests provide the most helpful insight regarding what is happening around the world of Black Desert, and many serve as an introduction or tutorial to help you experience various features for the first time and get you acquainted with them. First of all, quests from the Black Spirit are mainly related to combat, the main quest, and its rewards. So until you reach Lv. 50, it is good to go through its quests one by one. They will reward you with useful equipment and materials such as the precious black stone.Furthermore, quests help your game experience through the rewards they offer, such as Contribution experience, skill points, consumables, and more that are considered essential for one’s time inside the game.
That being said, you are not forced to proceed with most quests, and not doing quests won’t affect your enjoyment of the different types of content offered by the game.
However, please do note that certain features can only be unlocked, and important items received, by completing the quests related to them. These, in turn, might require to have progressed via the game’s main quest with at least one character.

➤ You can read more about how quests operate in the [Quest] page.


◈ Automatically move to your destination!
It is easy to use the navigation function when conducting quests.Either hover your cursor over the quest tracker, right-click the quest's title, or left-click the red button to activate navigation to the destination. After this, press the 'T' key to start moving your character automatically. This feature is called auto-sprint. Additionally, the path to a destination may be activated automatically by the system without you needing to set it or press anything. In this case, like previously, pressing ‘T’ will allow you to start moving toward it.


◈ Where is the NPC?
There are a huge number of NPCs in the world of Black Desert.Therefore, it may be difficult for beginners to find a desired NPC immediately.In this case, use the Find NPCs function.

At the top right of the screen, there is a minimap with a magnifying glass icon to the left. Clicking this will open the Find NPCs function window.Just click on the NPC type you want here and the auto-pathing route will be activated to the nearest NPC of that type.You can also search for a specific NPC by entering its name into the search bar.

Press the T key as you have learned, and you will automatically run to the corresponding NPC.




◈ Combat and non-combat stance
You can switch between the combat and non-combat stances by pressing the 'Tab' key. • Non-combat stance- Fast movement speed and low stamina consumption.- Cannot use combat skills. • Combat stance- Slow moving speed and high stamina consumption- A state in which acquired combat skills can be used.


◈ Can I use skill points on any skill that I want?
Of course! Feel free to put your skills points on any skill that you want. Combat skills can be reset any time if you are under level 56. Just try out any skill, and then you can reset them by right-clicking on them. To save on time, you can also reset all of them by pressing the ‘Reset All’ button.

We recommend not using skill points to increase your weight limit until you’ve unlocked all the skills for your desired fighting style (Awakening or Succession), as the weight limit ones take a considerable amount of skill points to invest into.




◈ The screen is too shaky when I’m in combat
Black Desert is an action-emphasized game.The camera effects are also a part of creating a dynamic scene.However, there are some people who feel dizzy until they get used to it. In this case, you can adjust it in the game’s settings.Esc > Settings > Display Settings > Camera Graphics.

➤ You can read more about the different available settings in the [Game Settings] page.


◈ How can I buy items?
In Black Desert, obtainable items include various kinds of equipment, consumables, and materials.You probably have a lot of questions about equipment when you start playing a game.The most basic things are usually available from NPC vendors. For better equipment, it is better to buy items through the Central Market.However, we recommend new players playing through a season to abstain from doing either of this, as the equipment given to them via the main quests and season content has its own easier to complete progression that involves spending no silver, the game world’s currency. Additionally, during season, your season character won’t be able to equip non-season equipment. To use the Central Market, you need to meet an NPC that has the title of "Central Market Director".This NPC is generally only available in the capital towns of every territory, such as Velia, Heidel, and Calpheon City.



It’s easier to find them if you use the Find NPCs function.If you go to the NPC, you will be able to use the Central Market.There, you can buy almost everything available in the world of Black Desert, registered for sale by other Adventurers.


◈ Fishing and gathering
If you are an Adventurer who focuses on accumulating different experiences rather than focusing just on combat, you may find it fun to go fishing.You may also enjoy finding all the gatherable materials throughout the world.

If you want to learn this life skill content in a tutorial form (via quests), call the Black Spirit and press the Guide button in its interface.As you advance through the levels of the different life skills, the Black Spirit will offer you a variety of leap quests.


▲ You can easily learn about the different life skills if you follow the guide.


◈ My character’s speed has slowed down
If you move to a location other than the paved road, you can have restrictions on movement speed depending on the state of the road, which is displayed at the top of the minimap.Also, if your character exceeds its own weight limit, its movement speed will be decreased as well.


◈ What should I do when I die? How can I resurrect?
If you are dead in Black Desert, you can resurrect from the nearest safe zone, such as the nearest town, or from the nearest node to your location.



The important thing to remember is that the resurrection in a town or node is only applied to places you’ve already visited. Therefore, be careful not to die in places where  your surroundings are immersed in the fog of war in the World Map screen, as you may resurrect far away. Additionally, if you die at Lv. 20 or lower, you can always use the Instant Resurrect option in the starting areas of the game.When you reach Lv. 21 or higher, you will need Elion's Tear to use this function.


◈ The character is not moving
When a character is trapped somewhere in the world, you can escape to a nearby area by pressing the Esc key and using the 'Escape' function from the main menu. However, once you use it, you will not be able to use it again until a certain period of time has passed.




◈ I want to take screenshots more clearly
If you press the Ctrl + U keys together, you can take screenshots without the game UI thanks to the game’s Photo Mode. ➤ You can read more about it in detail in the [Observe Mode & Photo Mode] page.
* The content of the game guide may differ from the actual game content, depending on the update and content changes.

If instead you prefer to customize the game settings yourself, you can do so via the various groups on the left: Performance Settings, Display Settings, Audio Settings, General Settings, and Interface Settings.

● Performance Settings: Options involving the game’s graphics, optimization, camera, and NPCs that affect the game’s performance.

● Display Settings: Options related to the game window, the game graphics, the camera range and effects, and the screenshot settings.Remember that if you set the screen to suit your PC’s spec, you can enjoy a more optimized game environment.

● Audio Settings: Options related to the game’s audio. For example, you can turn on or off a particular sound type, or control its volume.

● General Settings: Options related to several functions and features of the game, including some quality of life settings, toggle what names, effects, alerts, etc. you want visible on the screen, modify the way the World Map is displayed, choose the game’s language, and more.

● Interface Settings: Options related to the interface of the game. They include the game’s action, UI, quick slot, and other hotkeys, mouse options, and the settings in case you want to play with a gamepad.

◈ Performance Settings
In this group one can change the various settings that affect the game’s performance, be them graphic settings, game functions, camera settings, or NPCs visual effects.

The Graphics & Textures section shares all its options with the Display Quality section of the Display Settings group, and thus will be explained in that part of this page.The same applies for the Camera Performance section with the Camera Graphics section of the Display Settings group.


▲ Functions that can be modified to improve the game’s performance.

Among the options one can choose here are:
- Selecting the optimal frame for game performance, from 0 to 60.- Upscale options, which render in-game graphics smaller than the actual resolution: Normal upscale, or employing AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 1.0 (only in Remastered Mode or above).- Low-power option, to use less of your computer’s resources at the cost of game performance.- The attack decision effects during combat.- The effects when attacks and blocks miss during combat.- Performance Optimization, which raises your PC’s memory usage to optimize game performance.- Effect Optimization to give priority to effects or game performance.- Character Optimization to adjust from how far away other Adventurers (players) are visible.- The option to hide other Adventurers depending on the situation, for example when many of you are gathered at the same location, to avoid lag.


▲ Workers & Pets section.

Here you can toggle if you want to make your workers employed around the world visible, how many pets you want to see (all of them, only yours, or none), and if you want to hide certain secondary NPCs found throughout the world of Black Desert.

Please keep in mind that while most of the secondary NPCs may serve no purpose, some may give or complete certain quests. Due to that, if at any point you cannot find a specific NPC involved in a quest, uncheck this option, as it may be what is hiding the NPC from you.

◈ Display Settings
In these you can adjust the different display-related settings, such as game window settings, options that affect the game graphics, the display effects, the camera range and effects, and the settings for screenshots.

Black Desert supports functions to adjust the basic resolution of your screen, the game’s texture & graphic quality, as well as the ability to turn a variety of options on and off by yourself. Through this, you can change the display settings based on your PC spec and enjoy the amazing views of Black Desert’s world, or make swift movements in combat where hundreds of adventurers are fighting at once, in the best way possible.

– Game Window


▲ The Game Window section.

This section allows you to personalize various game window settings: If you want to play the game in Full Screen, Full Screen Window, or Game Window, the screen resolution, the scale of the user interface (UI), and the game’s crop mode which reduces the display area while maintaining resolution. This last one is a function that leaves the interface as it is, and only reduces the area where the background and the characters are being displayed. The picture that has to be displayed becomes smaller, and so the burden on the PC is lighter.


▲ If you use The crop mode, the burden on the PC decreases since the displayed screen becomes smaller.

– Display Quality


▲ The Display Quality section will let you change the overall graphic quality of the game.

This section will also allow you to toggle various other functions, including:
- Anti-aliasing: none, FXAA, or TAA.- SSAO, to display shadows more realistically.- Adjust the display clarity.- Display faraway objects more clearly.- The camera’s depth of field, depending on the focal point.- Display faraway NPCs more clearly.- A blink effect when your character is being attacked.- Reduce the build-up of snow when this weather effect occurs.- Display monster blood splatter effects.- Show or not bloodstains.

Regarding optimization, you have a few additional display options, such as:
- Remove effects from other Adventurers.- Remove faraway effects.- Specify the mode you want to use AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 1.0 as: Ultra Quality, Quality, Balanced, or Performance.

The downside to removing other Adventurers' effects is that you can’t grasp the skills the opponent is using during PvP.

As for upscale options, the downside to the normal upscale function is that the resolution goes down drastically because small pictures get expanded. But if you use this function on a low spec PC, it will help you greatly.


▲ In upscale mode, the resolution drops a lot, but it works great on low spec PCs.

– Effects


▲ The Effects section is useful for example in case you need to adjust the brightness of the game.

Here you can choose among a variety of photo filters to set the display’s color scheme, adjust the display’s gamma and contrast, the opacity of effects, and the intensity of the focus effect during combat.
When it's night time, or if you go into a dark cave, the screen might be too dark and you might feel uncomfortable. In times like these, you can use the gamma adjust function.As the gamma value goes up, the screen becomes brighter and you can see dark places relatively comfortably.
But when daytime comes and it becomes brighter, you might not be able to distinguish the screen properly since it’s too bright.


▲Comparison between Gamma 0%, which is the initial value, and 50%, which is the highest setting. When daytime comes and it becomes brighter, you might feel dazzled by too bright light, so you would need to adjust it to an appropriate level.

There are color vision aid options prepared for players with protanomaly and deuteranomaly.If you activate this function, some colors in the game change so that they can be easily distinguished.



– Camera Graphics

The Camera Graphics section will let you adjust the vision range and various camera effects.

For the camera vision range, remember that a lower range will improve the game’s performance. Both low and high range values present advantages.The advantages of setting the vision range higher are that the character becomes smaller and you can see further terrain around it.

The advantages of setting the vision range lower are that, since you are looking at the scene at a short distance, you can see the movement of your enemy more clearly.


▲ If you adjust the camera vision range, you will be able to look down at the character from a higher perspective.

Regarding the various camera effects, you can adjust the value of all camera effects via Overall Camera Effect, or specify via the below sliders such as Vibration, Blur Effect, Camera Angle (Action), and Camera Zoom (Action). Screen shake or afterimages happening during character's movement and their use of skills might be a bit too much for some Adventurers, and thus we recommend everybody sets them to their preferred values.

If you set them to 100%, you will be able to enjoy a more fun and lively experience, but if you feel dizzy by the overwhelming amount of effects, you can reduce or eliminate them.


▲ Example of all camera effects at 0%.

– Screenshots


▲ Screenshot section, which for example lets you decide if you want a watermark to appear or not in the screenshots you take.

You can change the resolution of screenshots you can take by using the Print Screen key in your keyboard. Depending on the graphic card you have, you can take high-resolution screenshots above 4K, which you can then set as your PC’s background with one click inside the game.

But if your graphic card does not support the higher resolutions (4K or 8K) that have been selected, even if you select the screenshot size as high-resolution, the screenshot will be taken in normal resolution size.

After taking a high-resolution screenshot, it takes a few seconds to process, so you need to be careful during a combat situation (PvP, combat zone, etc). We suggest that you take pictures in a safe environment.


▲ If you click the set wallpaper button, the screenshot you just tookbecomes your PC’s background wallpaper!

Do keep in mind that the ‘Set Screenshot as Background’ window does not show in Photo Mode.

On Black Desert screenshots the Black Desert mark (watermark) appears, and you can adjust the watermark type, location, size, and transparency in this section.


▲ Images where watermark transparency is adjusted.


▲ You can choose your watermark from the logosof all the countries where Black Desert is serviced.

◈ Audio Settings
The audio settings allow you to turn on or off the music that comes out when you enter combat, or the background music.
Not only that, as you can turn on or off the sound effects and various ambient sounds play separately as well.

It is possible to adjust the volume of each sound one by one while all the sounds are on.


▲ The Audio Settings.

For example, you can toggle if you want to be alerted when whispered by another Adventurer. You can keep the sound of the game on when sending the game to the system tray, in case something happens to your character.You can toggle if you want to hear music playing nearby of your character’s location.

Do you prefer to not listen to combat music and continue enjoying the track playing in a zone? You can choose to do that as well.

Ever wondered how the NPCs sound in Korean or Japanese compared to the English voices? Give it a try.

Below those options you have the following slider options:
- The overall volume of all sounds.- Music volume.- Overall sound effect volume, with individual sliders for combat sound effects volume, combat sound effects clarity, others’ volume, and music volume.

◈ General Settings
In the general settings you can enable or disable certain quality of life options, toggle names you may want to see, game alerts, and other information on screen, change how the World Map is presented, determine the language for the NPC voices, watermark, game itself and the chat channel, enable or disable the chat filter, and select if you want to receive invitations from other players and a few other options detailed below.

– Camera Graphics


▲The General Settings first section, Quality of Life.

Combat assistance is a nice tool to have if you’re starting the game. Aside from this option, you have the ability to toggle aim assistance, separate the different quick slots, simplify the UI, and activate a screensaver.


▲ The Simplify UI mode activated.

Using the Quick Slot option, you can drag more skills and items into quick slots, not only the basic 10 by default. Not only that, but you can also place the quick slot in a location of your choice.

You can edit the shortcut of quick slots as well. If there is an unused key such as -,= or \, they can be added as quick slot shortcuts, allowing you to use the item quickly during combat.

After selecting the quick slot, in the menu (hotkey: Esc) – UI Edit, you can move each quick slot to your preferred position.


▲ If you use the quick slot option you can not only usemore quick slots but also move the slots to any place you want.

– Show/Hide

The Show/Hide section will let you decide which elements you want to see in relation to a few topics:

Characters:
- Highlight your character when entering safe/combat zones.- Show NPCs you have quests with in different colors depending on the quest status.- Show the NPC in different colors depending on the amity status you have with them.- Highlight your allies in Conquest War in green/blue, and non-participants in orange.- Highlight enemies in red.- Show your guild members in blue.- Show your party members in green.- Show everybody’s pets, only your pets, or hide all pets.- Show or hide your fairy.- See or hide other Adventurers’ campsites.- Select the number of maids/butlers you want to make visible while inside your residence.

You also have an option to enable customization of the location of your HP bar, Black Spirit’s Rage gauge, and PvP button here. Once toggled on, you can alter them in the Edit UI function.

Show/Hide Miscellaneous:

- Show attack decision effects in combat. If you select it, attack results such as down attack and back attack will appear in text in the middle of combat.- Display defense icons.- Display when attacks are blocked or miss.- Enable or disable the combo video guide for characters below Lv. 35.- Enable or disable the skill combo guide, only usable if the skill guide is toggled on.- Make the mast of big ships transparent for better visibility.


▲ When you use various crowd control (CC) skills,the text is printed above the character who was attacked.

– Alerts

Here you can select which alerts to make visible.If you do not wish to see the system notifications that get displayed endlessly in the middle of the screen, you can turn them on and off through these options.You can just leave the notification messages that you are interested in and turn off all the other messages to make a cleaner interface. However, it is highly suggested for new Adventurers to initially disable most types of alerts until they’re more familiar with the function of each one.


▲ You can turn off the notification messagesthat get displayed endlessly in the middle of the screen.

– World Map

In this section you can select how you want the World Map to open with 3 possible styles or no animation, and set the camera angle for the World Map.

–  Language

Here you can set the language for the NPC voices between English, Korean, and Japanese, select what regional watermark you want the game to show, toggle on and off the game’s chat filter, in what language you want the game to be in between English, German, French, and Spanish, and what Chat-Channel you want to be in between International, English, German, French, and Spanish.

–  Miscellaneous

These are settings related to the navigation guide, interactions with other Adventurers, and others.

You can set the theme for the UI between the classic look or a few other options such as season: summer, winter, or spring.

You can toggle the navigation guide and customize it to show how the route that leads to your destination is represented.The basic setting is in guide arrows, but you can also choose between marked line where a dim light will appear, or guide fairy which lets you know the direction toward the light pillar that is your destination.


▲ When using the navigation function,you change the method of guidance toward your destination.

In addition to the navigation guide aesthetic, you can also choose between exact and smooth options for both land and water navigation paths. Each one offers advantages.

Regarding character interactions with other Adventurers, you can disable party and guild invites, duel requests, trade requests, and even Yar! requests.

Aside from these, there are a few other functions that can be toggled on and off. Rotate the minimap to match your character’s perspective, close window UI like your character profile if you’re hit, close full screen UI like the Pearl Shop if you’re hit, set the camera to follow the direction of your movement when using auto-run, enable LED animation effects for your Razer peripherals, and adjust the camera speed during auto-run.

◈ Interface Settings


▲ The interface settings will let you modify a great variety of hotkeys.

In all these sections you’re given the option to modify the hotkeys for keyboard and buttons for gamepad.

There are two types of shortcuts as a whole.There are the Action Hotkeys, where you can change the shortcuts for specific actions such as skills or using items, and the UI Hotkeys, where you can change the shortcuts of various UI windows.

What you need to keep in mind is that if the key you are trying to register is already in use, the original shortcut key disappears. So, after changing the shortcuts, you must see if there are any void shortcuts that have been created.

In Mouse Interface you can invert the mouse both horizontally and vertically, adjust its sensitivity, enable the option to move by pressing left mouse button (LMB), and lock the mouse cursor to not move outside the game display.

Similar options for gamepad are given in the Gamed section below, allowing you to use one, enabling the gamepad-only UI, its vibration, adjust its sensitivity, and invert the game’s movement like with the mouse.

Subtópico: Security Guide
Conteúdo do Subtópico:


In order to ensure stronger privacy and security settings for our Adventurers’ accounts, we provide multiple security solutions here at Black Desert.

You can protect your account with solutions such as password changes, OTP setting, and PC registration.

The first and foremost security solution is to regularly change your password.

Using the same password for multiple websites can greatly jeopardize your security. All it takes is one leak to leave all your accounts vulnerable. Therefore, it never hurts to make it a habit to regularly change your password.

Here is how to change your password:

Find [Account Security Center] in the left menu bar and click [Change Password], or click [Change Password] on the right.





OTP (One Time Password) is a temporary password that constantly resets. Using this on top of the regular password each time you log in strengthens the account’s security.

Accounts that use OTP are far more secure than those that do not.
Once you setup OTP, you will be asked to enter the OTP every time you login.
Although it will take an extra step to login, we highly recommend using OTP to protect your account.

Black Desert’s OTP service is provided by Google OTP application (Google Authenticator), and is completely free.

Here is how to set up your OTP service.








These 10 backup codes can be entered instead of your OTP or used to disable OTP settings if you do not have access to your authentication app due to the loss or malfunction of your mobile phone. However, please keep in mind that each backup code can only be used once.
We highly recommend that you save these backup codes separately from your devices by printing or writing them out.



9. Your OTP service has now been successfully set up. From now on, you will be generated a new OTP on the authenticator app every time you login to the game or on our official website.





* If you do not have access to your OTP, you can log in with a backup code provided when you initially signed up for OTP. Click the “Cannot enter an OTP verification code” button to enter your backup code.
Save the backup codes as you will be the only person who can access them. It will be difficult to provide support if you lose the codes, so please keep them secure.

Adventurers who are using OTP can check the current backup codes, generate new codes, or disable OTP settings by going to the OTP Settings page after logging in to our official website.

Still confused?
To make it easier for all Adventurers, here’s a detailed guide with screenshots.

- Each coupon code is a 16-digit alphanumeric key.
- Coupons have varying expiration dates according to each different event.

Subtópico: Mail & Black Spirit’s Safe
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
◈ Mail
To access your mailbox inside the game, press the "B" key, or click the mail icon in the bottom right part of your screen.



Mail is mainly used for system messages. To notify you of gifts and rewards the game shares with all Adventurers, to obtain items obtained from redeeming coupon codes, and occasionally to progress through in-game events.

Mail can only be received, and cannot be sent to anyone.

It may contain silver or items attached to it. You cannot delete mail until you’ve received the items attached in it. However, please be aware that mail with an expiry date will disappear from your mailbox even if they have an item attached. Due to this, always make sure to claim the items received from mail as soon as possible.

Items claimed from mail are sent to your character’s inventory, and silver is sent to My Silver.

If you have already received an item (or silver), and the mail has no expiry date, you can manually delete it. However, some Adventurers like to keep old mail around as proof of their history within the game!


▲ In yellow, mail yet to be checked. In gray, mail that has already been checked.

The All option selects all the mail on the current page of the mailbox, and the Delete option deletes the selected mail. The Support button will redirect you to the customer support service website.


◈ Black Spirit’s Safe
Like with the Mail feature, the Black Spirit’s Safe can be accessed by pressing the “B” key, or by clicking its icon in the bottom right part of your screen.



Both features can also additionally be accessed from the main menu (hotkey: Esc).
The Black Spirit’s Safe, like its name indicates, is a safe where items Adventurers receive via different means are stored safely with no risk of ever being lost.

Here one can find items received from the different types of daily login rewards, items earned in the Black Spirit’s Adventure dice board minigame, and rewards from specific boss encounters, such as the world boss Vell, the Heart of the Ocean.

The silver family funds received on a daily basis according to your overall family’s fame are also stored here.



In the example above you can see both Black Spirit’s Adventure and Login Reward sections within the safe.

Right click any item and it will be moved from the safe to your character’s inventory.Press the “Collect Silver Reward” button to collect the silver.
Press “Collect All Rewards” to empty the contents of the entire safe. Make sure you have enough space, and weight capacity, in your character’s inventory before you go ahead with this option.

Subtópico: Useful Tips - Earning Silver
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
Time is money, Adventurers!
So, whether you have only few minutes to spare or several hours, here are a few juicy tips to help you earn a little extra silver.
Daily quests are quests you can complete once every day.  One especially loved by Adventurers is “[Daily] Lara's Great Discovery and Bread”, which can be accepted in Heidel.
This simple but rewarding quest is great for obtaining Scorched Fragments, which are a key ingredient of the expensive Manos accessories.

How to proceed with "[Daily] Lara's Great Discovery and Bread"
1
Accept the quest from "Lara", the General Goods Vendor in Heidel.
2
Hand over Dough x100 (made from Potato, Sweet Potato, Wheat, Barley, or Corn) to Lara
Dough can be crafted by "Shaking" Mineral Water with a 1:1 ratio of powder made from one of the above-mentioned ingredients.
3
Select “Scorched Fragment” as a quest reward.
4
Complete this quest every day until you accumulate 15 "Small Four-leaf Clover" (a standard quest reward), then talk to Lara to accept the quest "Small Fortunes Yields Big Fortune".
5
Complete "Small Fortunes Yields Big Fortune" then proceed with the Bonus quest.
6
Repeat steps 1 to 5!
Use the above method to continually gather Scorched Fragments and other necessary ingredients to craft Manos accessories (earring, ring, belt, necklace), then sell them on the Central Market.   * You can purchase the powders necessary for the dough from the market.  * The other materials necessary for crafting Manos accessories can be purchased from markets as well.


▲ Velia coast, a popular auto-fishing spot for Adventurers!
"Auto-fishing" enables your character to fish automatically and is another great way to earn silver. Have your character cast their line at your desired fishing spot and then wait for a little time to pass. Before long, they’ll have caught several fish which you can use for Bartering or Imperial Delivery! It’s not without reason that auto-fishing is one of Black Desert’s more popular AFK activities.   * The following preparations will make your auto-fishing more efficient.

▲ A magical seed (e.g.: Hump Mushroom)
Adventurers who have achieved Farming Artisan Mastery or higher can reap extra silver by planting Magical Seeds, which have a chance of dropping each time Plant Breeding is performed on a crop.
By planting Magical Seeds then performing Plant Breeding, you have a chance of obtaining an Unusual Fruit, Mutant Plant, Plant with Rotting Roots, Seed Half Eaten by a Bird, or Premature Fruit.
Stonetail Fodder, which is needed for Dream Horses, can then be acquired by using Simple Cooking on two of these crops!
▲ Stonetail Fodder
When you perform Plant Breeding on a Magical Seed, you are guaranteed to obtain at least one more Magical Seed, thus making this a largely beneficial means of making silver as you can continue farming with Magical Seeds and sell any excess to vendors for profit.
* You can use Magical Seeds in Farming to gain fruits via Plant Breeding. Alternatively, you can harvest them instead to obtain a heap of crops that can be sold to vendors for a profit.
* For Adventurers who have yet to try out their green thumb in Farming, please refer to this [guide] below to learn how to get your Farming to Artisan mastery.


You can obtain boxes with world boss gear, crystals, gold bars, etc., by defeating World Bosses. If you’re lucky, you might also obtain more valuable items such as Vell’s Heart and Garmoth’s Heart.  But what do you do if Garmoth appears suddenly while you’re busy fighting monsters all the way over in Titium Valley?
World Bosses appear all over the world of Black Desert, but many canny Adventurers have started placing certain characters near these specific locations to catch them the moment they appear.
▲ e.g.) Characters placed to hunt down World Bosses
Using the above method, you’ll be able to consistently fight world bosses the moment they appear. This will grant you a steady income and pave your way to becoming a BDO gazillionaire!  * Please refer to the following [guide] for more details on World Bosses.

▲ You can see the locations of Dark Rifts on the World Map (M).
Defeating Bosses that appear from the Dark Rifts scattered across the world of Black Desert is another great way of obtaining silver. You can get quality accessories from the boxes they drop, a whole heap of Ancient Spirit Dust and, if you’re really lucky, maybe even “Remnants of the Rift,” which is a material required for crafting Blackstar gear. There are slight differences depending on which Dark Rift Boss you fight, but you should be able to kill these Bosses if your character is lv. 60 or higher and has PEN (V) Tuvala or Narchillan gear.  But even if you feel you lack the necessary level or gear to take these Bosses on, give it a try anyway. As your character won’t lose EXP or break crystals if they die at the hands of Dark Rift Bosses, you really have nothing to lose!  * Ancient Spirit Dust is used in Simple Alchemy to make Caphras Stones. Once crafted, you can then use them yourself or sell them on the Central Market.
* Dark Rifts respawn a certain amount of time after a Dark Rift Boss has been defeated.


The last tip on this list— the Black Spirit’s Adventure. You can open this window in-game by going to Menu (Hotkey: ESC) > Rewards > Black Spirit’s Adventure. This mini-game has you move the Black Spirit around a game board to unlock rewards along the way. You’ll be given a new pair of dice to roll every 30 minutes, 3 times per day. If the Oasis Buff is active, this increases to 5 pairs of dice per day. So next time you log in to your adventures, be sure to collect your dice and start rolling for those free rewards!  * Check the following [guide] if you want to know the details about this content.

Subtópico: Useful Tips - Raising Combat Stats
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
Are monsters getting too strong? Are you in need of better gear? Then look no further! Here, we have some practical tips that are sure to make your character stronger!
Try all the tips listed here in order. The tips in this guide start from the easiest to obtain, then get progressively harder further below. The tips here will help you make the most of your character’s capabilities.

If your character is lvl. 50 or higher, you should visit a Skill Instructor in any town to get valuable skill add-ons.

Getting add-ons for your skills will give them additional on-hit effects such as buffs, debuffs, HP and resource recovery, and more.

Don’t worry if you haven’t got skill add-ons before, they won’t cost you a dime! You only need to have the appropriate level to get them. So, if you don’t already have them, give them a try!
* You can get your first skill add-on at lvl. 50. At lvl. 60 you can have up to 6 skill add-ons. * If you already have add-ons for your skills, you will need Memory Fragment x1 to change them. * However, you can change your skill add-ons as often as you want without spending Memory Fragments for the duration of the 'Cliff's Skill Add-on Guide” buff or the 'Secret Book of Old Moon' buff.



② Draughts / Elixirs / Perfumes
Draughts, elixirs, and perfumes also give temporary buffs like food. But whereas food, can only be used one at a time to gain specific effects, draughts, can be used together with elixirs and perfumes to provide even more buffs.

▲ Check here to see which elixirs and perfumes can be used with draughts.

Alchemy Stones and Spirit Stones are equipped in the "Alchemy Stone" slot found in the middle of the Equipment window (hotkey: I). Press "U" after equipping a stone to get effects for a certain period of time. Alchemy Stones and Spirit Stones all consume durability when used. Alchemy Stone durability can be recovered using certain fuels ("Sturdy" grade or higher), but the durability of Spirit Stones cannot be recovered by any means. Despite this, Spirit Stones have similar effects to Alchemy Stones and tend to be cheaper.


* Click the checkbox below the Alchemy Stone slot in the Equipment window to have the effect of your Alchemy Stone or Spirit Stone refresh automatically every time the buff duration ends. * If you want to learn more about Alchemy Stones, check out the [Alchemy Stone].

Invest Contribution Points to construct a Refinery in town to make reform stones.
Villa buffs are available from the villas scatted across the region of Valencia. You will need to purchase a Villa Invitation for 10,000,000 Silver from the Villa Keepers to enter one. Once you enter a villa, go to the "Villa Butler" and pay them Gold Bars to get the buff. (It costs around 1,500,000 Silver for a 90-minute buff, and 4,500,000 Silver for a 180-minute buff). There are 3 different types of villa buffs, but the villa buff with the best combat effects is the "[Villa] Body Enhancement (180 min)."
[Villa] Body Enhancement - Effects

Before you head off for a villa, you should check which villa offers which buff as the buffs available at each of the villa differ.

[Villa] Body Enhancement - Available Locations
▲ ① Lohan's Villa ② Atosa's Villa

You can get the "[Villa] Body Enhancement" buff from the 2 locations shown above: Lohan’s Villa and Atosa’s Villa. Be sure to grab the buffs when going to Gahaz, Titum, and other monster zones in Valencia as the villas are fairly nearby.* If you want to learn more about Villas, check out the [Villas Guide].

When you complete certain pages of the Adventure Logs that reward you with stats, these stats are applied to all the characters in your family.
It will take you some time to finish all the Adventure Logs, but it is definitely worth investing the time as they provide permanent buffs for the family. You will also be able to explore various locations and content in Black Desert while completing the Adventure Logs. We have listed the Adventure Logs below that give AP and DP as rewards.

* Adventure Logs offer numerous other rewards for completion such as HP, Stamina, Accuracy, Evasion, Weight, Inventory Slots, items, and increase max Agris Fever.

Subtópico: Season Server FAQ
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
This is a collection of most frequently asked questions from Adventurers regarding the season servers.

For the complete guide to the different aspects of season content, please check the following pages.

Q. What’s so special about season content?

Compared to normal characters outside season, you can level up both your season character and its equipment (gear) at a much faster rate.
Q. What happens to my season character when I graduate?

Once you graduate from a season, your season character can continue to be permanently played in the normal servers. Season characters do not disappear.
Q. I have an existing character, would it be helpful to create a new character for the season?

In short, yes.In Black Desert, there are many advantages that can be gained by having various characters within a family, such as a greater energy pool.You can also share locations and equipment between two characters in the same family through the Tag Characters feature.

In addition, the season is an opportunity to obtain good rewards and buffs that can benefit existing Adventurers as well.
Q. Can I create multiple season characters?

You can only have one active season character. After deleting an existing season character, you can create a new season character again.However, keep in mind that if you delete a season character, all information and items possessed by the deleted character will be permanently gone, so please choose carefully.
Q. Can I play season characters only on the season server?

Seasonal characters can also be played on regular servers.However, please note that you can obtain Tuvala equipment enhancement materials such as Time-filled Black Stones, Refined Magical Black Stones, and Tuvala Ores only in the season servers.
Besides having an extra character slot available and a season character ticket, there is nothing else in particular that you need to prepare ahead of playing on the season servers.You can see your available season character tickets in the character selection screen.

Season characters can equip quest gear and accessories acquired from completing the main questlines of Valencia, Drieghan, Kamasylvia, and O’dyllita, so veteran Adventurers make sure to prepare these in advance to guarantee an easier leveling experience.
Nope! You can either create a season character right away, or store it and use it later! Play the seasons when you want.

If you do not log in for more than 180 days, automatic graduation will be processed.
Q. When do I get a new Season Character Ticket?

The first ticket will be delivered after the Sep. 20 (Wed) maintenance. After that, season character tickets are issued periodically and can be obtained when logging in.

You will be able to check the number of tickets you have accumulated in the character creation window.

You can have up to 5 season character tickets per family, however, there can only be one season character active. You can create additional season characters after graduating the active one first.
Q. I wish to level my season character faster.
If you open up the Pearl Shop (hotkey: F3) and look at “Black Spirit’s Pick” → “Silver Event Items,” you can find and purchase the [Event] Combat & Skill EXP 530% Scroll (60 min) to add some speed to your leveling experience.We recommend using these scrolls in monster zones from Lv. 50 or higher.
Q. I wish to change my season character.

You can delete your season character and create an entirely new one.Please be aware that if you delete your season character, all of their items including gear and season pass rewards will be deleted as well, and cannot be recovered.

Season pass rewards can only be claimed by your active season character, and you will not be able to reclaim them with an entirely new season character after having claimed them before on a deleted season character. Therefore, take care to move all of your items into a town storage before proceeding to delete any character.

Additionally, you do not have to worry about your existing season character tickets. While they’re needed to create a season character, they’re only consumed when graduating said character. As such, deleting season characters does not affect the number of available tickets you have.
Q. Can I convert an existing character to a season character?

No. You will need to create a new character with a season character ticket to enjoy seasonal benefits.
Q. What are the goals in a season server?

1. Create a season character.2. Level up through the main questline.3. Reach Lv. 56 and complete the Awakening & Succession questlines.4. Grow strong with the Naru gear, enhance them to PEN (V) grade, convert them to Tuvala gear, then enhance these to PEN (V) grade as well.5. Explore the rest of the world of Black Desert as you see fit.

You can also engage in a variety of life skill contents such as fishing, farming, and cooking, all on the season server.
Q. I completed a Season Pass challenge, but I can't claim my reward.

Season pass challenges must be claimed sequentially, starting with the topmost challenge in order to receive subsequent rewards.

Therefore, please collect the rewards for the previously completed challenges first.
Q. What’s the “simplified” main questline?

Adventurers who have already completed the main questline all the way up to Mediah on a previous character and completed the pet reward quest [Pet] Bareeds' Junaid, can opt to skip the main questline via this system. It is heavily focused on leveling your season character but also grants rewards similar to those from completing the main questline up to Mediah.

The simplified questline is available only for season characters and requires you to complete the main questline up until meeting with Alustin, the resident alchemist of Velia.New Adventurers who have yet to complete the Mediah main questline cannot choose the simplified questline.
Q. I already chose the main questline. Can I switch to the simplified questline instead? / I’m currently doing the simplified questline. Can I switch to the main questline instead?

Unfortunately, once you’ve chosen to proceed with either the main or simplified questlines by the end of Balenos’ main questline, you cannot make the switch to the other.The simplified questline will unlock Valencia’s main questline once you reach Lv. 56.
Q. Where do I get the season weekly quests?

You can check the weekly quests of the season server from the Quest window (hotkey: O) → Recurring → [Season Weekly] Stronger Tuvala Gear.

You can check the quests for each monster zone, and select one of them.(Once you complete one quest from this list, other quests will become unavailable until the weekly reset. This quest weekly reset is on Thursday at 00:00 UTC.)
Q. Is it better to graduate early?

As soon as you’ve completed the season pass challenges and claimed all the rewards from the window, you can graduate your season character.
Monster zones on the season servers drop seasonal materials such as Tuvala Ores, Refined Magical Black Stones, and Time-filled Black Stones in addition to the normal loot tables, and once you’ve enhanced all of your Tuvala gear up to PEN (V) grade, you can sell the remaining materials to vendors for silver. Thus, some Adventurers will postpone their seasonal graduation to squeeze every ounce of silver they can earn from these monster zones, while other Adventurers will seek to graduate as soon as they possibly can in order to quickly continue with guaranteed PEN (V) accessory and/or boss gear questlines to further strengthen their characters. If you’re still uncertain about when exactly you should graduate, we recommend that you continue to gather silver on the season server before you come to a decision.
Q.  I want to graduate, but it does not let me.
Until you claim all the rewards from the season pass, you cannot graduate from the season.
Q. When can I redeem my special season reward?

You’ll be able to claim your special season reward after your season character reaches Lv. 10 or higher, and completes the corresponding season pass challenge which rewards the “Season Special Gift Exchange Coupon.” You will need the “Season Special Gift Exchange Coupon” to claim your seasonal reward, and you can also pick rewards from past seasons you’ve yet to claim (only one per season character).
Please note that the season special gift exchange coupon is not a physical item, but something added directly to Fughar’s special season reward interface once acquired.
Q. I’ve graduated from the season server. What now?

Once you’ve graduated from the season server, you can continue to experience the variety of content offered in the world of Black Desert and claim rewards for doing so through the “Progression Pass.”If you wish to obtain even stronger gear, you can try your hand with the “Guaranteed PEN (V) Boss Gear” and/or “Guaranteed PEN (V) Accessory” questlines.
Please check the [Guaranteed PEN (V) Boss Gear] and [Guaranteed PEN (V) Accessory] pages for more information on the latter two features.
Q. What is Fughar's Letter of Encouragement? Where is it used? Can I exchange it for a reward somewhere?

The item that can be exchanged for a special season gift is the Season Special Gift Exchange Coupon item. Fughar’s Letter of Encouragement is simply a letter congratulating the Adventurer on graduating from the season server, with no practical use, so you can keep it or delete it.You might confuse the two, as they share the same icon!
Q. Can I create a new season character after graduation?

You are free to create a new season character after graduation, as long as you have a season character ticket. If you do not have any active, you will need to wait until the next ticket release.

Q. If I graduate on one character, and then immediately create another season character, do I get another season pass with all the rewards?

Yes!  Every season character you create will be able to progress through the season journey and collect the rewards.

Q. Do the season seal rewards refresh with a new season character?

No. Rewards marked "Once per Family" are only able to be obtained once.

Q. I read something about a timepiece. Can I still get a Fughar's Timepiece?

With the new Tag system, Fughar's Timepiece has been removed and cannot be obtained anymore.

Note that if an Adventurer still has a Fughar's Timepiece from the Summer Season, this item will be deleted during the regular maintenance on December 17, 2023 (Wed)

Q. I heard I could obtain PEN (V) boss gear and accessories. Where can I find them?

You can proceed with the “Guaranteed PEN (V) Boss Gear” and “Guaranteed PEN (V) Accessory” questlines after graduating from the season server.The “Guaranteed PEN (V) Boss Gear” questline requires you to have TET (IV) Tuvala gear from the season servers.

Check the two pages linked above for more information on these features.
Q.  If I enhance multiple sets of Tuvala gear, can I equip them with different characters?

Once your season character has graduated and has been converted into a normal character, you will see that only one full set of Tuvala gear per gear slot (two for earrings and rings) has been converted to be usable by your now normal character. All other Tuvala equipment pieces you may had are automatically deleted.
Remember, the Tuvala gear with the highest enhancement grade will be converted for each slot (2 for earrings and rings).

Subtópico: Season Progression Basics
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
Summary
• We recommend that you progress your season character via the main questline.
• For Adventurers who are well-adapted to playing Black Desert, the simplified main questline is a way to progress quickly.
• Refer to the Season Pass for easier character progression while receiving rewards.
If you are an Adventurer in a season server for the first time, it is recommended that you progress your character via the main questline.Even if you have been playing Black Desert before, it is recommended that you progress your character via the main questline if you are not used to the world of Black Desert.

As you complete a variety of quests in the main questline, you’ll travel throughout the world of Black Desert, as well as receive a variety of rewards helpful in progressing your character.

You can accept quests from the main questline from the Main Quest option from the Black Spirit (hotkey: , ).



Remember that you press the (,) key to summon the Black Spirit, and accept a main quest (Q).

You can check the main quests that you have accepted from the Main Quest window on the right part of the screen. Right-click them to navigate to the quest location. You can conveniently move to the location by using the Auto Run (hotkey: T) function while the Navigate function is activated.

◈ Which Crossroads quest should you select? “Choose any.”
From time to time, you may get crossroads quest options while proceeding with the main questline. You can check a synopsis of the storylines for each crossroads quest when you’re about to choose them.

No matter which quest you select, the overall gameplay is unaffected, but there are obtainable knowledge entries and different storylines that you can experience only with certain crossroads quests. For your initial character, you can freely choose the crossroads option that interests you the most, since all options will allow you to continue with the main storyline once you’ve completed the crossroads quest.



It doesn’t matter which crossroads quest you select. The counter at the top lets you check the number of times you’ve selected each crossroads quest with your family of characters.Do keep in mind that eventually, you will need to experience all the different crossroads options with different characters if you wish to obtain all their unique rewards.

However, if you already are a veteran Adventurer, you may see you’re offered the simplified questline by the Black Spirit after speaking with Alustin in Velia, and once more at the end of Balenos’ main questline. Please check the next section for more information on this.


◈ Simplified Questline



If any character in your family has completed the quest [Pet] Bareeds' Junaid, which can be obtained once you’ve completed Mediah’s main questline, you can skip the main questline up to and including the Mediah questline via the ”simplified” questline with a season character.Although you can receive the main rewards from the main questline every time you reach a certain level when selecting the simplified questline, you need to level up by finding and going to the monster zones yourself, since there are no main quests to complete for you.

Remember!The requirements to access the simplified main questline are the following:• Playing on a season character.• Completed the main quest [Balenos] Dark Clouds Over Velia.• Having completed the quest [Pet] Bareeds' Junaid previously.
Once you fulfill the requirements above, you will be prompted via a crossroads questline selection window to choose between the original or simplified main questlines.Keep in mind that once you pick a questline, you cannot change your selection!

It may be a fast way to progress a character for Adventurers who are well-adapted to the world of Black Desert. However, Adventurers who are not yet familiar with the game may have difficulty with the simplified questline, so think carefully before selecting.


◈ Gear for Season Characters
Season characters cannot equip normal equipment. They can only equip season-exclusive gear or gear obtained from the main questline.

Adventurers usually enhance Naru gear up to PEN (V), exchange it for PRI (I) Tuvala gear, and then enhance the Tuvala gear up to PEN (V).

Check out the details for this process on the [Season Gear Guide] page.



You can receive rewards for the progression of your character via the Season Pass window while on a season server. You can also refer to the season pass as a kind of guide for the different types of content features available in a season server, and how to further progress your character.

Note that for characters taking the simplified questline, you can complete the season pass by talking to the Black Spirit (hotkey: , ) once your character has reached a certain level.

After selecting the simplified main questline, the following season pass challenge will change.

• Season characters are restricted from using normal gear and can only equip “Naru” and “Tuvala” gear.
• You can obtain and enhance Naru gear by completing the main questline.
• You can obtain Tuvala gear by exchanging Naru gear or seasonal materials.
• You can obtain materials to enhance your Tuvala gear from a variety of means such as defeating monsters or completing weekly and regional quests in monster zones.
Unlike normal characters, season characters can only equip and use gear with a special seasonal mark on the gear icons. The yellow mark seen in the picture below.Once a season character has been converted into a normal character through graduation, they can use all kinds of gear without restrictions.



Thus, season characters will start with Naru gear, then progress through PEN (V) Naru gear → Tuvala gear → PEN (V) Tuvala gear.You can obtain Naru gear from the main questline, and you can exchange Naru gear into Tuvala gear.

Your first task upon logging into the season server will be to enhance your Naru weapons and defense gear up to PEN (V) enhancement level.

Naru gear is readily available for novice players, and, once enhanced to the maximum level, can be exchanged for Tuvala gear.



You can obtain Naru gear from main questline rewards.To enhance Naru gear, you will need “Beginner Black Stones” which are also given out as main questline rewards.

Once you enhance your Naru main weapon, sub-weapon, helmet, armor, gloves, and shoes to PEN (V), you can exchange them for PRI (I) Tuvala gear via the UI in the equipment window (hotkey: I).Enhancing Naru accessories such as a necklace, rings, earrings, and a belt is somewhat difficult. They also cannot be converted into Tuvala accessories, so we recommend you simply equip them without enhancing them to higher levels.




Season characters can obtain Tuvala gear by either converting PEN (V) Naru gear or exchanging Tuvala Ore. Tuvala gear is exclusive to season servers and is the best gear set for season characters.




You can enhance all Tuvala gear pieces including accessories up to PEN (V) level, and you can use the gear for the “Guaranteed PEN (V) Boss Gear” questline upon graduating from the season server.

To enhance Tuvala gear, you will need season-exclusive materials such as Time-filled Black Stones and Refined Magical Black Stones which can be obtained from a variety of means, such as defeating monsters, completing weekly and regional monster zone quests, and season pass challenges.

➤ Please check the [Guaranteed PEN (V) Boss Gear] page for more information regarding the use of converted Tuvala gear after a season has ended.


Tuvala Ore, Time-filled Black Stones, and Refined Magical Black Stones each have certain monster zones where they drop in greater quantities. You can find out more from each item’s tooltip description.

You can also obtain seasonal materials through other means such as season pass rewards and event rewards.

You may find the max durability of your Tuvala gear depleted and/or lacking the necessary enhancing materials to continue being enhanced.

The following information will help you enhance your Tuvala gear more efficiently.

Enhancing Tuvala Gear Tips

Exchange your PEN (V) Naru gear for Tuvala weapons and defense gear.

You can exchange your PEN (V) Naru gear for PRI (I) Tuvala gear, which lets you skip the process of enhancing Tuvala gear through 0 to +15 enhancement levels.   Therefore, it is more efficient to exchange your PEN (V) Naru main weapon, sub-weapon, helmet, armor, gloves, and shoes into PRI (I) Tuvala gear.     Upon completing your Awakening and/or Succession questline after reaching Lv. 56, you will be rewarded with your very own PRI (I) Tuvala awakening weapon.


Utilize “Enhancement Chance (Stacks)” and “Naderr’s Band.”

Enhancing any piece of gear utilizes a system of “Enhancement Chance,” where “stacks” are built over successive enhancement attempts.  The higher the stack, the greater the chance for successfully enhancing a piece of gear. You can also increase your odds by exchanging Black Stones or using items such as Advice of Valks and Valks’ Cry.  Failing enhancements will continuously increase your overall stack, which you may want to save to use for enhancing gear with lower success rates via Naderr’s Band.

Please check the [Enhancement] page for the basics of this feature.


Use Magical Refined Black Stones to enhance your Tuvala gear from DUO (II) → TRI (III).

While using Magical Refined Black Stones will consume your gear’s max durability, they guarantee successful enhancement of your Tuvala gear up to TRI (III).   You cannot use these stones from TET (IV) and onwards, so utilize these Magical Refined Black Stones especially for DUO (II) to TRI (III) enhancement to save your “Enhancement Chance” and “Time-filled Black Stones.”   Note that you cannot use the Magical Refined Black Stones to enhance Tuvala accessories.


Use the Frozen Tides Black Stone to enhance from TET (IV) → PEN (V).

You can obtain “Frozen Tides Black Stones” from the Season Pass or by completing the seasonal version of the Atoraxxion dungeon. They guarantee successful enhancement of Tvuala gear up to PEN (V).   Therefore, it is most effective to use these stones to enhance your Tuvala gear from TET (IV) to PEN (V).


Failing to enhance accessories will destroy them! Loads of Tuvala Ore is required!

Unlike Tuvala weapons and defense gear, Tuvala accessories can only be enhanced with the same type of accessory. (Ex: Tuvala Rings require another Tuvala Ring to enhance)   Therefore, you will need several of the same accessory type to enhance Tuvala accessories, which in turn will require a decent amount of Tuvala Ore.


Obtain Advice of Valks through the Season Pass

Complete Season Pass challenges to obtain Advice of Valks items.   These are simple challenges that require your season character to equip a piece of Tuvala gear enhanced to the appropriate level, so don’t miss out!


Find a party for “Rift’s Echo.”

The Rift’s Echo is a season-exclusive monster summon scroll.   Use the Rift’s Echo to summon a random boss monster, who, once defeated, will award you with a variety of Tuvala gear that will help you in your seasonal journey. Rift’s Echo requires a full party to complete, so utilize server chat or the Find Party/Platoon function to find like-minded Adventurers to take the monsters down.   Each party member may have a different number of Rift’s Echoes on them, so you should discuss this within your party before proceeding with this content.


Use the appropriate Enhancement Chance to enhance your Tuvala gear.

Many Adventurers utilize the following Enhancement Chance stacks when enhancing to certain grades.   Your success rates may vary regardless of the recommended stacks.

Enhancement Grade
Weapons / Defense Gear
Accessories
PRI (I)
-
10 (+5)
PRI (I) > DUO (II)

TRI (III) > TET (IV)

35 (+10)
TET (IV) > PEN (V)
60 (+15)

Level up to obtain a PEN (V) Tuvala Earring and PEN (V) Tuvala Ring.

You can obtain these by progressing through the Season Pass and leveling up your season character.   Reaching Lv. 58 will grant you a PEN (V) Tuvala Ring, and reaching Lv. 60 will grant you a PEN (V) Tuvala Earring, so we recommend that you only enhance one Tuvala Ring and Tuvala Earring to PEN (V) each.


Lastly, you can check the [Season Server FAQ] page for a list of frequently asked questions regarding season content.

* The content of the game guide may differ from the actual game content, depending on the update and content changes.

Subtópico: Season Server-exclusive Content
Conteúdo do Subtópico:

The season servers offer a variety of content to help your season character progress, such as rift’s echo, ancient weapon invasions, seasonal Atoraxxion, and seasonal Red Battlefield.



While in a season server, you can use a party boss summon scroll item called a Rift’s Echo.You can acquire rift’s fragments from defeating monsters, and combine them into rift’s echoes.



Using these items at a designated location on the season servers will spawn violent boss monsters. Once defeated, they will reward your season character with items useful for their progression.

There are three stages to each Rift’s Echo encounter, and after the first two stages are complete, there’s a chance to spawn a special monster for the third and final stage. Defeating these monsters within a certain time frame will reward you with additional rewards.

A special violent monster can appear in the third stage of the Rift’s Echo, which has a chance to drop better loot as well.

Soloing a Rift’s Echo encounter is extremely difficult, so we recommend using the Find Party/Platoon function available in your main menu (hotkey: Esc) under Community (F8), or on your screen below your health bar, to find a group of five like-minded Adventurers to proceed together.





Ancient weapon invasions have a random chance of occurring when you are defeating monsters in the territories of Mediah and Valencia while in a season server.

Once an ancient weapon invasion begins, the event area will darken as a system warning message will display, and after 30 seconds, a horde of ancient weapons will appear.

The greater the number of Adventurers in the vicinity, the more ancient weapons will appear, which will also increase the number of possible rewards.

Upon defeating all ancient weapons and the final boss monster, you can obtain the following rewards.

Ancient Weapon – Final Boss Subjugation Rewards
- Time-filled Black Stone - Tuvala Ore - Refined Magical Black Stone - Specter's Energy
- Sharp Spirit Stone of Destruction
- Sharp Spirit Stone of Protection
- Tuvala Accessory Box
- Can obtain Tuvala Accessory enhanced up to DUO (II).

Subtópico: Season Graduation
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
Summary
• You can convert your season character to a normal character via graduation on a season server and have the restrictions on equipping gear lifted.• You can proceed with graduation yourself at any point. (Season Pass completion is required) • Your Tuvala gear will also automatically be converted when you graduate. (You cannot further enhance your converted Tuvala gear.)• For special season rewards, you can also select season rewards from previous seasons.• After graduating from a season server, you can take on quests for guaranteed PEN (V) accessories and PEN (V) Boss gear as well as gain access to the Progression Pass.

You can convert your season character to a normal character via “graduation.”

You can progress further with no restrictions on equipping normal gear, although you can no longer log into a season server with your now normal character.








◈ Season Graduation
Graduation is always available, but you can only graduate from a season server after you’ve completed your season character’s season pass. Please be careful with your decision, since graduating consumes a season character ticket, and if you no longer have at least one of these you cannot create a season character again nor log into a season server.


If you are using the Black Spirit Pass, you must claim all Black Spirit Pass rewards as well.If you have purchased the Black Spirit Pass and haven’t used it, it is recommended that you do so before Season Graduation, since you cannot use it after graduation, and all rewards will be lost if you haven’t claimed them before.

Once you’ve completed all the requirements, you can graduate by pressing the Graduate button that will appear in the Season Pass window.



Your season character will be converted into a normal character, and will automatically be relogged into the game upon pressing the Graduate button.




◈ Converting Tuvala Gear
Once graduation is complete and your season character is converted into a normal character, you cannot equip season-exclusive Tuvala gear.
Upon graduation, each piece of your season Tuvala gear set with the highest enhancement level will be automatically converted into normal Tuvala gear, and all other duplicates removed (except for rings and earrings which will have a maximum of two of each converted).E.g.) If you have one PEN (V) Tuvala Gloves and one TET (IV) Tuvala Gloves, only your PEN (V) Tuvala Gloves will be converted and the other will be removed.

(Reference) Order of Priority When Season Tuvala Gear Is Converted into Normal Tuvala Gear:


It is recommended that you use or sell “Tuvala Ores,” “Time-filled Black Stones,” “Refined Magical Black Stones,” consumable items including other materials and items relevant to the season server, and gift boxes for leveling up before you graduate, since they will all be removed.


◈ Summary & Additional Season Graduation Notices



◈ Season Special Gift
You can receive a season special gift once you’ve reached Lv. 10 on a season character.On the season pass you will be rewarded with a  x1 Season Special Gift Exchange Coupon.Note that your Season Special Gift Exchange Coupon won't be found in your inventory, but can be exchanged by talking with Fughar in town.Speak with Fughar and select the special rewards you want to receive with the Season Special Gift Exchange Coupon Fughar will show on the Special Season Gift window.

However, remember that this are once per family rewards, and thus you cannot accept season special rewards that you’ve already received previously.
The all-new season grants 2 season character tickets, meaning you can obtain up to 2 Season Special Gift Exchange Coupons.If you've claimed all available season special rewards, hold on to your coupon! More gifts are scheduled to be added in a future update.

Lastly, with the [Season Special Gift] Unstoppable Wave of Dreams quest removed, all Adventurers with 2023 Summer Season Characters who weren't able to complete the quest in time will automatically obtain an extra Season Character Ticket.

Once you’ve graduated from the season server, you can enjoy Black Desert in your own unique way by exploring the different regions within Black Desert’s world, go challenge stronger monsters or other Adventurers, or work on developing your life skills.

It is recommended that you try the quests for guaranteed PEN (V) accessories and guaranteed PEN (V) boss gear if you wish to become stronger.  If you want to experience a variety of content in Black Desert, such as Hunting, Cooking, Gathering, etc. you can also learn about them and receive rewards via the Progression Pass.


◈ Quest for Guaranteed PEN (V) Accessory
You can take on daily quests to work towards a PEN (V) accessory of end-game quality at a guaranteed success rate.

Please check the [Guaranteed PEN (V) Accessory] page for a full explanation of this feature.


◈ Quest for Guaranteed PEN (V) Boss Gear
You can use your PEN (V) Tuvala gear obtained from the season server to upgrade it to PEN (V) boss gear, the ultimate end-game goal, via reform stones at a guaranteed success rate.

Please check the [Guaranteed PEN (V) Boss Gear] page for a full explanation of this feature.


◈ Progression Pass
It’s a system that guides you through a variety of content in Black Desert’s world and grants rewards.
You can start the Progression Pass by pressing the Progression Pass icon on the upper right of the screen ( ). (You cannot work through the Progression Pass with a season character.)



Lastly, you can check the [Season Server FAQ] page for a list of frequently asked questions regarding season content.


◈ Tag Characters for Post-Graduation Growth
You can tag two characters in your family, which allows you to instantly switch between the tagged characters. Tagged characters will share their in-game location at all times.(For example, if tagged character A moves to a monster zone, then switches to tagged character B, B will log into the exact same location in said monster zone.)Note that you can only tag normal characters.

The tag system has been revamped to allow tagged characters to now share EXP gains.By alternating between tagged characters, you could potentially level up multiple characters at a time.


Once you've tagged two characters, you can also enable them to share the same gear. This feature is known as "Item Copy."Complete the Marni's Suspicious Device questline available from Lv. 56 through the Black Spirit (hotkey: , ) to unlock the Item Copy feature. You can find the questline on the Quest window (hotkey: O) → Suggested → [ADV Support] [Lv. 56] Item Copy with Marni's Device! When copying items, all equipped defense gear, weapons, accessories, tools, alchemy stones, and artifacts will be copied into the bags of the tagged character.Copying items consumes "Marni's Unstable Fuel."

Please note that the copy is mostly like taking a screenshot of that moment in time from the character you’re copying the items from. As such, changes such as upgrading alchemy stones or weapons with hearts and cups will not be reflected on the copies.
* The content of the game guide may differ from the actual game content, depending on the update and content changes.

Subtópico: Servers
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
Black Desert’s servers work in a One World System. Each region is considered a world. Example: North America (NA) is its own world, and Europe (EU) is a different world. Characters are accessible across an entire region, no matter the server. You can access any server with any character, barring a couple of restrictions explained below.

Jumping from one server, also called a channel, to another has a 5-minute waiting period. However, guilds can assign 3 channels as their "Guild Base Servers". On these channels, you can swap back and forth without the 5-minute waiting period.
However, for those servers assigned as base servers by a guild, all guild members can jump between them with no waiting period.

Servers are separated into server groups. Each group shares the same server chat.For example, if you enter the Serendia 1 server, you can chat with Adventurers currently in Serendia 2.

There are a few servers that serve special purposes:


◈ Season
Only season characters can access them. They’re tailored for the season experience, which includes for example being able to obtain certain items in them that are only used in season content.

New Adventurers should join the Season 1 (Novice only) server, as it offers a better initial experience. Please do note that once a new Adventurer has reached a level above 200 (counting the level of all characters) they will no longer be able to access this server.

Seasons come and go, and thus you may see no season servers available in the server list during the down time from one season to the next.

Please note that certain items and functions are restricted from being used in season servers, such as Caphras enhancement and certain alchemy stones (Vell’s Heart and Khan’s Heart) for example.


◈ New Olvia
New Olvia servers can only be accessed by new or returning Adventurers. These servers are considered growth servers, and offer an increased rate of character experience gained by the Adventurers that can play in them. In detail:

– You get +150% combat experience and +50% skill experience from Lv. 50 onward.
– You get +100% life experience for any Life Skill under Artisan 1.
– You get additional contribution experience that varies on the amount of contribution points you already have (from +150% to +50%, decreasing the more points you have).

Please note that in New Olvia servers you can only level characters up to Lv. 61 (61.99%).
What is considered a new or returning Adventurer?

– Adventurers logging in within 60 days (1440 hours) of creating a character family are considered new Adventurers.– Adventurers still within 60 days (1440 hours) of setting up their secondary password are considered new Adventurers.
– Adventurers who haven’t logged in to the game for at least 30 days (720 hours), and haven’t used the Web Central Market (via the Black Desert+ app or the official website) for at least 30 days are considered returning Adventurers.
Note that World Bosses will NOT appear in New Olvia servers.


◈ Arsha
Arsha servers are PvP-centric. They offer better item drop rates (+50% item drop rate) when defeating monsters, but any form of PvP (even forced) is not penalized.

As with ordinary servers, PvP can only be activated by Adventurers above Lv. 50.While initiating an attack to kill another Adventurer will NOT lower one’s karma, if a character with already negative karma enters a PvP server, the usual non-karma penalties will still be in effect.

Note that World Bosses will NOT appear in Arsha servers, both normal and season ones.


◈ Node/Conquest War
Most servers that end with the number 1, like Calpheon 1, host node and conquest wars, a PvP feature, every day. During these conflicts, monsters disappear, and a passerby is at risk of getting involved if they’re unaware of the locations that take part in the battles.
Node wars are held in all the aforementioned servers, while conquest wars are held in Calpheon 1, Mediah 1, and Valencia 1.

Each server wages war over its namesake territory. For example, in Calpheon 1 the conflict is over the territory of Calpheon.

Conquest war occurs on Saturday, while node wars occur all other days.



In the image above can be seen the different symbols for various servers, with their name shown in the legend.• The yellow speech bubble, which indicates season servers.• The red sword and shield, which indicates the PvP-focused Arsha servers.• The green EXP symbol, which indicates New Olvia servers.• The yellow shield with a crown, which indicates your guild’s base servers.• The crossed yellow swords, which indicate there is a node / conquest war in progress in the server.• The red general prohibition symbol, which indicates you cannot move to another server for 10 minutes after moving to one.• The yellow and red danger symbols, which indicate scheduled and ongoing maintenance in the server.

Conquest war occurs on Saturday, while node wars occur all other days.

Subtópico: Trial Character
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
Do you wonder how a class fully plays out in combat at higher levels? That is what trial characters are for.

It is a system where you can create a Lv. 60 character and play it in a limited space, receiving exclusive equipment that only trial characters can wear and the necessary amount of skill points to max out all the skills.

Do keep in mind, you cannot access a server where node and conquest wars are carried out with a trial character.



Create a character after pressing the Trial tab at the top right part of the Character Selection screen.



Once created, log into the game with the new character.You can purchase several products from the nearby NPC Vendor for Trial Characters, Haz.



The total sum of your AP and DP with the gear given is about 620.



After this, learn all the available skills with the skill points you’re given.



What can you do after setting up your Trial Character?

• Try different skills on scarecrows or monsters placed in different places in the area.
• Fight against other Adventurers in the general arena or the 1 vs. 1 arena.

Subtópico: Character Profile
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
The first information you will see here in the top left will be a picture of your character, its class icon, level, followed by the character’s name, family name, character’s health, MP, weight, and total playtime of that character.
• Level
Levels serve to measure your progression and give an indication of your strength. As you level up, you will receive skill points and increased carry weight, health points, and for example resistances.

The level difference between a monster and player can be identified by the color of the monster’s name. While defeating low-level monsters will have diminished rewards, higher level monsters will yield greater experience, but they’re more difficult to defeat.


• Family Name
Your family name is a unique name chosen for all of your characters on a specific server (NA or EU). It is displayed above every character you create, and once set, it can only be changed via a specific coupon gifted by the game during occasional events or purchased in the Pearl Shop.

Please note that the family name is chosen before character creation after a server is selected.


• Health
You will gain health points (HP) matching your overall level & health level, increasing the amount of damage you can take before being defeated.

Over time, any lost health points will regenerate, but you can restore health quickly by consuming potions and using certain skills.

When your health is reduced to zero your character will be knocked unconscious. Once unconscious, you are allowed to revive on the spot with a special item, or you can opt to return to the nearest node or town.


• Skill Resource
In order for a character to use a skill, each class has a unique skill resource.

– Warrior, Berserker, Lahn, Musa, Maehwa, Mystic, Striker, Kunoichi, Ninja, Guardian, and Drakania use Willpower (WP) as their skill resource.
– Sorceress, Tamer, Witch, Wizard, Hashashin, Corsair, Sage, Ranger, Archer, Shai, Woosa, Maegu, and Dark Knight use Magic Power (MP) as their skill resource.
– Valkyrie and Nova use Sacred Power (SP) as their skill resource.

Among these, MP and WP are recovered gradually over time, but SP is not.Most skills use up skill resources, but you can also use certain skills to attack or defend from your opponent to restore a certain amount of your skill resource.

Keep in mind that, the more powerful a skill is, the more resources it consumes.On the other hand, if you use a skill with its unique key command instead of registering it in a quick slot, you can also reduce the consumption of skill resources.

Regardless of the resource type of each class, you can also restore it by consuming MP potions.

Potions can be purchased through General Goods Vendor NPCs in each town, and can be obtained as rewards for completing certain quests. You will recover as much MP/WP/SP as the size of the potion: small / medium / large / extra-large.


▲ Every class has skills to restore its own skill resource.

If you find it hard to get MP potions, or find that the weight of potions is burdensome, it is also possible to restore skill resources with Herbal Juice, which is obtained via simple alchemy.

To get Herbal Juice, gather Sunrise Herb, Silver Azalea, Dry Mane Grass, Silk Honey Grass, Fire Flake Flower, or Weeds, and process them with Mineral Water using Simple Alchemy (hotkey: L). These plants can be found in the wild and gathered, and the resulting Herbal Juice weighs less than potions.

You may further process Herbal Juice through simple alchemy into Concentrated Herbal Juice, High-Concentrated Herbal Juice, and Refined Herbal Juice, each one more potent than the previous one.

Additionally, through skill specialization, also known as Skill Add-ons, you can add recovery effects of MP/WP/SP to a skill to effectively manage your skill resources without depending on potions or Herbal Juice during combat.
For every 2 levels achieved after reaching Lv. 50, you can choose one skill and two possible effects that can be added. Some of them recover MP/WP/SP.


▲ From Lv. 50 to Lv. 60 a character can add a variety of effects to skills.
A number that represents the weight of the items you can hold at the time.

As your body gets heavier, if you go over the weight limit your movement speed and attack speed will gradually decrease.

Item weight limit cannot exceed a maximum of 170% of the total capacity, with 100% being the limit before starting to receive penalties due to being overweight. Therefore, once you reach this percentage you may not be able to acquire or purchase further items.

All movement and attack speed is normal up to 100% of weight, it is slightly slower between 101 ~ 125%, a lot slower at 126 ~ 150%, and you might find yourself unable to move after that.

Note that you cannot jump after weight exceeds 126%.

Mounts such as donkeys, mini elephants, wagons, etc. can carry more weight than characters do.


▲ As weight increases, movement slows down, so you need to empty your inventory or unload items to reduce weight.
• Family Playtime
As you level up characters, level up their Life Skills, and gain knowledge entries and Contribution Points, your fame will increase.

The more fame you earn, the bigger the benefits the game will bestow upon you. The more combat, life, and special fame you gain, the more silver you’re given passively every day.

The more family fame you have, the sum of the previous three types, the more extra silver you can collect from Central Market operations. At the highest benefit obtainable you can also have an additional +10% item drop rate.
This numeric figure represents the character's karma.

When defeating monsters, the figure goes up. When you defeat other players non-consensually, steal from NPCs, or kill protected fauna such as horses or other animals in Kamasylvia, the number goes down.

If a character is Lv. 50 or above, has activated PvP mode, and attacks or defeats another Adventurer, the karma value will decrease drastically.

If the karma value is less than 0, the character's name is displayed in red, and they’ll be attacked by the guards protecting the different towns of the world. The character may also be attacked by other
Adventurers.

If your character is defeated when they’re at a negative karma number, there may be major disadvantages and penalties applied, such as the possible decrease in enhancement level of the equipment worn by the character.➤ You can read more about this feature in the [Karma] and [Death Penalties] pages.
A family-wide numeric figure that represents your standing at sea. Above 0, you’re considered a law-abiding marine. Below 0, you’re considered a pirate.

Damaging or destroying another Adventurer’s ship will decrease your naval fame.

If you’re a pirate your ship will be marked in red, which will allow other Adventurers to attack it without having to activate PvP mode.

Additionally, pirates are not welcomed in most wharves, and will only be able to load supplies in the pirate haven of the Kuit Islands.

Naval fame can be recovered by defeating sea monsters and doing a repeatable quest in Velia.
This is a renewable point currency that can be spent when a character interacts with NPCs or performs certain actions in the game.

It is mainly used to raise amity with NPCs, and to obtain knowledge entries. The maximum number of energy points that you have is shared by all characters in your family.However, the energy points that you currently hold may be different for each character in your family, as they’re spent independently for each one.

You restore 1 energy point every 3 minutes when you’re online with a character, and 1 per hour for all other off-line characters.Therefore, if you need to consume a lot of energy, it may be helpful to create multiple characters.

You can recover energy more quickly if you complete certain repeatable quests in towns, lie on a bed you have installed in your residence, relax at certain locations in the game world, or consume energy potions. These can be obtained by yourself by exchanging energy through NPC Alustin, or by purchasing them from other Adventurers in the Central Market.From time to time, event versions of these potions, called energy tonics, are given by the game during events, and they can also be earned from the Black Spirit’s Adventure minigame.

The maximum amount of energy points starts at 30, and is increased each time you complete a knowledge topic.

The easiest way to increase the maximum points of energy is to talk to all the merchants in towns, and node managers throughout the world.



➤ You can read more about this in the [Energy] page.
This number indicates the extent to which you have contributed to the world’s various societies, and can be used in a few different ways. They can be used to invest in nodes, to link trade routes, or to have workers gather materials from each location. They’re also employed when purchasing houses in town, or borrowing certain items from an NPC. They are not spent and regenerated like energy points, and thus you can take back any contribution point you spent on your investment and rental at any time by undoing your actions (uninvesting, returning the rented item).

The easy way to raise your contribution points is to do quests that give contribution experience. You will see most quests in the world reward this type of experience. Resolve the troubles of NPCs you encounter and enjoy the rewards.You can also earn contribution experience by exchanging byproducts obtained in certain Life Skills.➤ You can read more about this in the [Contribution] page.
This displays the horoscope’s constellation to which the character belongs. One can earn more amity with NPCs of the same horoscope when conversing with them.

The horoscope of the NPC can be found in the amity window.

The horoscope’s constellation must be set when a character is created, and it cannot be changed again.


Physical training increases the character’s basic fitness ability.

– Breath: Walk or run around without the use of a mount to increase it. As you level it up, a character’s stamina is increased permanently.
– Strength: Travel with a trade pack to increase it. You will see a character has a backpack on it and moves slower when there is a trade good item in its inventory. As you level it up, the total weight limit of the character is increased permanently.
– Health: Eat food to increase it. Dishes can be cooked by yourself, can be obtained as quest rewards, and can be purchased from the Central Market. As you level it up, the total HP of the character is increased permanently.
These values represent the ability potential inherent to the character.

You can increase them through various ways, such as wearing certain equipment, or consuming cooked dishes or elixirs.

Each ability has 5 levels.

Note that these levels can decrease as well if you receive a debuff or have an equipment piece decreasing them.

The effect of each ability is as follows:

– Attack Speed: A higher level increases attack speed. Attack speed affects the Warrior, Hashashin, Ranger, Guardian, Drakania, Corsair, Lahn, Berserker, Tamer, Shai, Striker, Musa, Maehwa, Mystic, Kunoichi, Ninja, Dark Knight, and Archer classes when they execute skills.
– Casting Speed: A higher level increases the casting speed of skills. Casting speed affects the Sage, Sorceress, Nova, Woosa, Maegu, Valkyrie, Witch, and Wizard classes when they execute skills.
– Movement Speed: A higher level increases movement speed, which makes you move around faster.
– Critical Hit: A higher level increases the critical hit rate.
– Fishing: A higher level shortens the time taken up until a fish bites.
– Gathering: A higher level shortens the time taken for all gathering activities.
– Luck: A higher level increases the item drop rate for your character.
It is the sum of the attack power of the equipment worn by the character, and it affects the amount of damage the character can deal.

The attack power figure summarizes the attack strength of the worn equipment, not including any increase due to magical crystals or skill add-ons.
Stamina is a number that indicates how long a character can be active without getting tired.

If the total stamina increases, the character can sprint (Shift + W) for a longer time, and some skills that consume stamina can be used more often.

If stamina is all used up, there will be disadvantages. For example, sprinting will not be possible, and swimming speed will decrease drastically.

Stamina recovers quickly once you’re not sprinting, swimming, diving, or using it for a skill.However, it does not recover naturally if you’re doing any of those activities.
As a resistance value rises, it’s more likely that you don’t get affected by an opponent’s debuffs.

The basic resistance value for all characters is 20% for each type, and it can be increased through the use of certain types of equipment items, consumables, or using skills that increase their value. You can also increase the percentage by infusing magical crystals into your equipment pieces, for example.

Even if you increase the resistance values to be higher than 80%, when engaging in PvP they will only be applicable up to 80%.

Other than that, if an opponent Adventurer has the ‘Ignore All Resistance’ effect, the resistance values actually applied may be lower than what is shown.

– Stun/Stiffness/Freezing Resistance: The higher the number, the greater the chance to protect against the opponent’s Stun / Stiffness / Freezing debuff effects.
– Knockdown/Bound Resistance: The higher the number, the greater the chance to protect against the opponent’s Knockdown/Bound debuff effects.
– Grapple Resistance: The higher the number, the greater the chance to protect against the opponent’s Grapple debuff effects.
– Knockback/Floating Resistance: The higher the number, the greater the chance to protect against the opponent’s Knockback/Floating debuff effects.
Each time you perform a Life Skill activity, you can earn experience points and raise its level.

As the level of a Life Skill rises, effects such as obtaining additional rewards or increasing its efficiency when you carry out the activity are unlocked.

In addition to that, every time a Life Skill reaches a certain level, you will unlock the ability to wear Life Skill clothes sold by luxury goods merchants in towns and use better performing tools related to the activity.
You can compare the ranking for each field, including the various Life Skills levels, overall wealth, character growth, and Red Battlefield score. You can see the family name, character name, and the joined guild of the Adventurers who rank in from the 1st to the 30th place for each field.

If you are not in the 30 first places, you are given a position in a category from A to E.

Field ranking will only count information of adventurers on the same server.
Titles are a way to show yourself and others milestones you’ve achieved during your time in the game. From defeating a strong boss, obtaining a rare item, advancing through your Life Skills, or participating in an event, there are titles for all kinds of activities.

Titles are divided into four categories: World, Combat, Life, and Fishing.

Each title has a required action to take to obtain it. As you check each one, you’ll see the left side will tell you how to get it.

A title can be displayed on top of your character’s name, and while each individual title has no effect on its own, the more titles you obtain the greater the benefit you’ll receive.
▲ The title you earned can be displayed on the top of your character’s name by pressing ‘Apply’.

The more titles you obtain, the more maximum energy and stamina you will be awarded, as well as being given passive bonuses such as additional item drop rate via the Luck statistic, and additional increased experience.
This tab automatically records various actions taken from the time a character is created.The base unit to record is a day, and you can check the detailed recording time by hovering the cursor over each event.

The journal is important in case you want to look back on your adventure.
Challenges is an achievement system consisting of rewards that enable the users to enjoy the game more smoothly as they progress.

Each achievement has a clear direction to obtain it, and all of them are displayed from the moment you create a character.

The different tabs represent challenges to be completed by reaching a goal, like leveling up, given after spending enough time playing the game, and those available via ongoing events.The other tabs show you challenges already completed, and rewards to claim.

For challenges requiring playtime, keep in mind they only count time spent within the game. Time spent on the launcher, the title screen, or anything else outside of being logged in with a character into the world will not be counted toward completing these.

A notification in the bottom right will tell you when you have unclaimed rewards from completed challenges.

Subtópico: Black Spirit
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
Initially, your black spirit is a floating ball of black smoke with glowing red eyes, but much like yourself, it will grow as you progress during your adventure through the world of Black Desert. The black spirit will be your companion, your guide, and that nagging voice that leads you forward.

In order to understand the world of Black Desert, you need to interact with various NPCs.They know a lot of things you do not, and they provide you with everything you need to explore the world and continue your adventure. But as is often the case, it is not common for most people to talk to and trust a stranger. Help NPCs to the extent of your power. They will become a strong ally to rely on as your story progresses.


◈ Quest Window Interface
Press the default hotkey “O” to show your Quest Window.



1. Quest Category Tab: You can select the category of quests you want to view: Ongoing quests, Main quests, Suggested quests, Recurring quests, or New quests.

● Main quests are those that advance the game’s main story.

● Suggested quests are lists of quests that direct you to unlock game features and/or serve as tutorials for them, but they can also be quests that lead you to obtain important items.An example of the first would be [ADV Support] Family-fitting Inventory, which unlocks the family inventory feature. An example of the second would be [ADV Support] Tool Bag for Better Convenience, which rewards you with Liana’s Tool Bag, an essential item for the Gathering Life Skill.

● Recurring quests are lists of useful quests that can be repeated on a daily or weekly basis, depending on the quest.For example, Combat ones will direct you towards obtaining better equipment, while Contribution ones will guide you to obtain Contribution experience to increase your Contribution Points.

● New quests are those recently added to the game. They tend to be related to new features or ongoing events.

2. Groups: You can group ongoing quests by region (Balenos, Serendia, etc.) or type (Black Spirit, Story, Town, etc.)

3. Classification: If you select to see quests by Region, quests will be arranged by the region they’re from (Mediah, Drieghan, etc. as seen in the image above). If you select to see quests by Type, quests will be arranged by their type. Press each group to close or open it.

4. Quest Tracker Display: If you uncheck this box found to the left of every quest name, your quest will not appear on the quest tracker.

5. Quest Options: These allow you to forfeit an ongoing quest, display the location of an ongoing quest in the Minimap and World Map and activate a navigation route to reach it, and to auto-run to the location of a quest, which in addition to showing the location of an ongoing quest, automatically moves your character towards it.

6. Preferences: This is a function that allows you to choose which kinds of quests to receive from the Black Spirit and NPCs. You can only receive quests belonging to the activated type.


The Quest Summary window appears to the right when you click on a quest.



7. Basic Reward: Everything that appears within the slots to the right is obtained.

8. Optional Reward: Upon quest completion, you must select one of the rewards within the slots to the right. Only one is obtained.


◈ Quest tracker
The quest tracker that is displayed on the right side of the screen, below the Minimap, distinguishes main quests (Black Spirit and story quests, at its top) from other types of quests.

These Black Spirit and main story quests will guide you through the story and show you Monster Zones for each appropriate level, as well as reward good items and introduce you to each territory’s variety of content. They will always help you explore the world of Black Desert, so you should always pay attention to the quests displayed at the top of the quest tracker.

The yellow part at the top of the quest tracker shows the three most recently received or completed requests.Even if you conduct many quests at the same time, it takes just a glance to view the progress of your quests.



1. Main Quest: The main quest that is in progress or the next one to do and not yet accepted is displayed here.

2. Settings: You can configure the quest tracker in more detail.

3. Recently Updated Quest: Up to three newly taken or completed quests are displayed first.

4. Completed Quest: Completed quests get crossed out by a golden effect and the completion target appears in green. You can receive rewards by talking with their designated NPC.

5. Quest Options: In addition to the Quest Options icons explained above, here you can also find an icon to remove a quest from the quest tracker.

6. Quest Type Icon: You can identify what type of quest it is; for example Story quest, Black Spirit quest, Repeatable quest, and more, through this icon found to the left before every quest’s name.

Click on any quest in the tracker to open the Quest Window and display more information on them.



In the World Map screen (hotkey: M), you can also view the summary of your quests and the area they involve.



In the World Map screen, right-click on the quest icon to view the path to the area.


◈ Preferences
Completing quests is a way to get a variety of rewards including Contribution experience, useful items, knowledge entries, and more.However, because there are so many quests in Black Desert, it may be a little harder to complete all the quests you encounter at the start of your adventure.Therefore, you will be able to select the type of quest you want only if your character is level 20 or above.

If you press the Settings button in the quest tracker, or check the Preferences section at the bottom of the Quest Window, you can select the type of quests you want to be visible.
If you want to ignore all combat quests and only receive Life Skills quests, you can select 'Life Quests' in the settings. If instead you want to do all the quests in Black Desert, you can select the ‘All Quests’ option.
If you want to proceed with a repeatable quest, such as daily quests, you can select 'Other quests'.



You can receive only the kind of quests you want by pressing the filter located at the bottom of the Quest Window or the quest tracker's 'Settings' button.


◈ Is It Necessary to Do Quests?
Quests provide the most helpful insight regarding what is happening around the world of Black Desert, and many serve as an introduction or tutorial to help you experience various features for the first time and get you acquainted with them.

Furthermore, quests help your game experience through the rewards they offer, such as Contribution experience, skill points, consumables, and more that are considered essential for one’s time inside the game.

That being said, you are not forced to proceed with most quests, and not doing quests won’t affect your enjoyment of the different types of content offered by the game.

However, please do note that certain features can only be unlocked, and important items received, by completing the quests related to them. These, in turn, might require to have progressed via the game’s main quest with at least one character.


◈ My Desired Quests Do Not Appear
Some quests only appear after you’ve completed their requirements.Depending on the quest, the requirement might be a certain statistic of the game, like your character’s level, or having completed previous quests.Other quests for example only appear when you have a specific knowledge entry to unlock them, or when your character moves to a certain location of the world.

Quests that appear on the Suggested list of the quest window (hotkey: O) have their requirements listed. If the quest you want to carry out does not appear at the NPC, make sure that the requirements are met.



If a quest does not appear, please check its requirements. These are often a required character or life skill level, time of the day, or having completed previous quests.


◈ How to Receive a Quest
To receive a quest, you must go to an NPC who is waiting for an adventurer. An NPC with a quest has an icon with a yellow border over its body. Get close to an NPC and press the interaction key (R) to listen to their concerns.

You can check the progress and completion status of a quest according to the color of the icon border at the NPC.
- Yellow means the quest has not been accepted yet.- Blue means the quest is in progress.- Red means the quest’s objective is completed and you can complete the quest at the NPC.

Please note that quests for Life Skills activities such as fishing, gathering, alchemy, and others, are shown in light green, not yellow, when they’ve yet to be accepted.

​​​​​​​

You can see the different colors according to the quest type and status.

In addition to regular NPCs, you can also receive quests through the Black Spirit, objects in the world, and items. If you belong to a guild, you can receive various kinds of guild missions too.A guild mission’s reward is given only if the quest has been completed within a certain period of time from the point when the Guild Master pays the down payment in advance and accepts it.

Rewards for guild missions are made up of the essentials for guild operations.


◈ Quest Type
There are seven types of quests in Black Desert:
You may notice what type the quest is by the icon in front of the quest title.

1. Black Spirit: The black spirit gives you this quest when you reach a certain level or meet certain conditions.



2. Story: This quest contains stories about Black Desert’s world and its characters.



3. Town: This is a basic quest given by any NPC throughout the game.



4. Exploration: These quests send you to find new areas.



5. Trade: These quests are related to the purchase and sale of trade goods.



6. Life Skills: This type of quest will require you to carry out an activity related to a Life Skill, like cooking a dish or gathering herbs.



7. Repeatable: Quests that can be repeated at set intervals. Daily quests reset every day at midnight UTC time, while weekly quests reset on Thursday (Wednesday to Thursday), also UTC time.




◈ Crossroads Quests
A crossroad quest is one in which the contents of it are changed by your choice. When certain quests are accepted, another NPC (most of the time the Black Spirit) will intervene and give a different quest to do in its place. If you accept this new quest, the previously accepted quest is automatically canceled.

It is better to choose a crossroad quest after checking both quests’ rewards rather than choosing it thoughtlessly, because the reward tends to be totally different for each quest.Keep in mind that if you cancel the quest your option will be reset and you can make the selection again.

Additionally, during the main questlines, various crossroad situations are encountered. While one may want to do one choice or another depending on their personal objective, for example doing the quests as quickly as possible or wanting to follow a certain path for the story, please keep in mind that all main quest crossroad options must be completed at one point or another to receive all the different rewards available in each separate one.

As main quests can only be done once per character, you will need to choose different main quest crossroad options with different characters to obtain all the unique rewards, most of the time knowledge entries.


◈ Quest Reward
When you complete a quest, an NPC offers a variety of rewards:

Contribution experience, skill points, combat experience, all kinds of consumable items, and more, that are essential for the game experience.It is more efficient to obtain skill points and contribution experience by completing quests rather than acquiring them by other methods.
Quests that guide you through an unfamiliar feature will give you rewards that are related and useful for said feature.

A wagon that is convenient for trade, a gathering tool required for gathering, magic crystals required for transfusion, furniture that can be installed in a residence, etc. rewards such as these are given to anyone who completes the quest.

When it comes to optional rewards, you must select one of several rewards.

Remember that if the number of empty inventory slots is smaller than the number of reward items, or smaller than two, you cannot complete the quest. Items you don't use can be sold to a vendor, stored in storage at a town, or discarded into the trash.

Subtópico: Inventory
Conteúdo do Subtópico:

When you check the Inventory (hotkey: I) window, the Newbie Inventory button will open automatically as well.This inventory, visible only to new Adventurers, has no weight limit and is meant to serve as an extra helping hand during one’s first weeks in the world of Black Desert.

Click the move button at the bottom and right-click the item you want to store or retrieve.After the period of new Adventurer benefits ends, you can no longer store items in the newbie inventory but can retrieve the items you stored there at any time.

Please note that trial characters cannot use the newbie inventory and that certain items such as quest items, junk items, character-bound items, contribution items, trade goods, mount emblems, and guild-related items cannot be placed in this temporary inventory.



The family inventory is a convenient bag that all characters in the same family have access to.It allows you to store certain types of items that can then be accessed via the same window with all your characters.

➤ You can read more about this feature in the [Family Inventory] page.

If you have too many items in your inventory and find it is difficult to organize them, you can use the Auto Arrange function. If you tick this option, the inventory items will be sorted in a specific order, allowing you to better locate them.

If you instead want to keep items in a specific location of the inventory, turn off the Auto Arrange function. This way, you can change the position of items in the inventory as you desire.
If you have item pieces that can be converted to a new item by arranging several of them in a specific shape in your inventory, such as Ancient Relic Crystal Shards, you can only combine them with the Auto Arrange function turned off. For these, in the inventory window you have to arrange a certain number of item parts in a predetermined shape, as only then the combination button will be made available to transform the item parts into a complete item.The item tooltip description will explain what shape is required to combine the items.

If you cannot proceed with the combination although you have deactivated the Auto Arrange function and arranged the item parts in the correct order and shape, check if there are other item parts for combination in the inventory. If there are other item parts with the shape arrangement complete and the combination button activated in the inventory, the item parts must be first converted or disarranged to deactivate the combination button. Only after that the combination button for the item parts you originally wanted to transform will appear.

This feature, found on the top right part of the window next to the Auto Arrange button, allows Adventurers to easily view their items according to their usage.


Please note that one needs to change back to the Slots sorting option to arrange and combine item pieces.


Additionally, be careful with the weight limit, as the heavier your character becomes, the slower its movement speed and attack speed will be, which will lead you to be exposed to danger without the ability to properly defend yourself.



Please note that if the weight exceeds 170%, no more items can be obtained.


◈ Item Deletion
If you want to discard items to make the character lighter, hold click on them and drag them to the trash can icon. After confirming the deletion pop-up window, the item will disappear. Alternatively, you can also drag them out of the inventory, for the same effect.Additionally, you can first press the trash can icon, aptly named Throw Item Away, and select various items all at once to delete them.Although a confirmation window will appear before the item disappears, be cautious not to inadvertently discard the wrong item.



In the case you’ve deleted a valuable item by mistake, please press the Recover button located between the Discard and Throw Away Item buttons.
This function will allow you to restore certain valuable items within set parameters. The deleted item can only be restored within 30 days of its deletion, the service can be used 2 times per month per family, it resets on day 1 of every month, and the number of restorations to use does not carry over from one month to the next.

In the case the item you wish to restore is not identified by this function as being valuable enough, please contact customer support.

The Find My Item function is convenient to check the equipped gear, silver, and items across all your character & mount inventories, town storages, Black Spirit’s safe, and Central Market warehouse.

This function can be found by going to the main menu (hotkey: Esc) → Function (F8) → Find My Item, through the search function in a town’s storage, or by simply pressing the hotkeys Ctrl+F.



You can also directly retrieve items from the Find My Item window to your character’s inventory when using a maid or butler.The retrieval of items stored in the Black Spirit’s safe does not require a maid.However, equipped items cannot be retrieved.

For more information on maids and butlers, please check the [Maids & Butlers] page.

You can use all 192 slots of the pearl inventory from the time that a character is created, without additional expansion needed. Pearl items have no weight, so you don’t have to worry about that. When you want to discard an item stored in a character’s pearl inventory, just like you do with the normal inventory, drag the item to the trash can icon at the bottom right of the window or drag the item out of the inventory. In comparison to the normal inventory, the Throw Item Away trash can icon will not allow you to select various pearl items at the same time to delete them, and clicking it will instead open the Item Recover window to restore your deleted pearl items. It is the same system as with the normal inventory, and thus the same rules apply.

1. Inventory Tab: Inventory window for normal game items.

2. Pearl Inventory Tab: Inventory window for pearl items.

3. Family Inventory Tab: Inventory window for the family inventory.
You can read more about this feature in the [Family Inventory] page.

6. Category Sorting: Sort the items by slots or categories.

7. Inventory Slots: A visual bar and numerical value that shows how full your inventory is.

8. Throw Item Away Button: The trash can into which you can drag and discard items. As said previously, be careful when you discard an item, as while the item recovery function will help you a couple of times per month, and the customer support service can assist you further, it may be possible for an item to be unrecoverable.

9. Weight: Shows both numerically and visually the weight your character is carrying. Hover the cursor above the weight icon to the left to see the detailed weight of both inventory items and equipped items.

10. Enhancement, Transfusion, Artifact Inventory, and Liana’s Tool Bag: These buttons open, from left to right, the Enhancement window, the Transfusion window, the Artifacts window, and Liana’s Tool Bag.

Subtópico: Family Inventory

This page is about the family inventory functionality. For information on the inventory basics of Black Desert, please check the [Inventory] page.

Shakatu, the Valencian Mogul, discovered a special ancient artifact at the Cantusa Desert, and has called upon Adventurers to visit Shakatu's Territory. After witnessing the ancient artifact, Adventurers have dubbed it the "Family Inventory."

The family inventory is a convenient bag that all characters in the same family have access to.It allows you to store certain types of items that can then be accessed via the same window with all your characters.

The following item types may be stored:

Please note that the below items cannot be moved to the Family Inventory:

◈ How to Obtain and Expand the Family Inventory
Adventurers who are Lv. 60 and above can receive the [Shakatu’s Gift] Invitation quest from the Black Spirit, also seen in the Suggested tab of the Quest window (hotkey: O) in the [ADV Support] [Lv. 60] Family-fitting Inventory section.Once your character reaches Lv. 60, the Family Inventory button will appear in their inventory, and pressing it will lead you to the quest as well.

Subtópico: Energy
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
These are points shared by all characters in your family that get spent mainly when interacting with NPCs and objects. They’re a renewable resource, and individual to each character.This means that, if you have a maximum of 30 energy points, you can spend 30 points with character A, and also 30 points with character B.

Energy is mostly used to become friends with townsfolk, to acquire knowledge entries, and for certain life skill activities. It can also be used to learn skills without going to a Skill Instructor NPC, and for a variety of content such as checking the price of trade goods in another town from a distance.

Energy regenerates gradually; 1 point of energy will be recovered every 3 minutes when you are playing with that character, and 1 point of energy will be recovered every 1 hour when the character is logged off. That means that in order to quickly recover the energy pool of a character, it is better to stay around within Black Desert’s world.

When your character is lying on a bed installed in a residence, the energy recovering speed will be increased. The same is also applied to certain locations around the world, like hot springs. You can also use crafted items such as energy potions to quickly refill your energy points if necessary.Finally, some quests, usually daily quests requiring you to use energy, will give you back energy points as part of their quest reward.

Maximum energy begins from 30 points, and will be increased every time you complete a knowledge topic category. For example, the category Residents of Velia.The easiest way to increase your maximum energy is to talk to every NPC within a town, and every node manager out in the world.



As seen in the image above, you will need to spend energy when obtaining certain knowledge entries found throughout the world. In the image you can see that, from a total of 543 energy the character possesses, 10 are required to be spent to interact with the object and obtain the entry.


• ConversationNPC conversation is one of the first features you will encounter. Conversations with NPCs are carried out to increase your amity with them. This is done to unlock interactions with them, such as quests and knowledge entries.The NPCs with whom you can converse are preset, and conversation cannot be performed if you lack the knowledge topics the NPC is interested in.The initial amount of energy needed to start a conversation is 2, but it will increase as your amity with the NPC increases.

➤ You can read more about this topic in the [Amity] page.

• Greetings
Approach an NPC to view its interaction options. Click on the hand icon, or press the hotkey F5 when the interaction options appear, to make your character wave its hand to greet the NPC and increase your amity with them. 3 energy points will be used, and you will gain 3 amity points.



• StealingAfter you reach a certain level, the stealing icon will become active when you go behind an NPC.If you use 5 energy to try stealing, you may be able to steal the NPC’s belongings.However, if you fail, the NPC will be disappointed with you, resulting in a significant decrease in amity, and a decrease in your character’s karma as well.




• Learning Knowledge from NPCsThere are many NPCs throughout Black Desert’s world that will teach you knowledge entries. To do this, you will usually need to spend energy.Each knowledge entry requires a different number of energy points which you must spend to learn it.

➤ You can read more about this aspect of the game in the [Knowledge] page.

• Returning Defense TokensReturning defense tokens give contribution experience. You can get them by defeating certain monsters forming raiding parties at night near gateway nodes. Every defense token returned will require you to spend 3 energy.



➤ You can read more about this in the [Contribution] page.

• World ChatWhen you participate in the World Chat, every message sent will cost you 1 energy.

• GatheringAll gathering activities consume energy. All gathering activities except for fishing will consume energy. 1 energy will be used every time you gather something. The more you level up your gathering life skill, the less energy will be consumed over time. The same applies to the farming life skill when gathering crops.

• FishingYou can consume up to 10 energy each time you throw your fishing line. This will give you the chance to obtain one extra fish.

• Trade BargainWhen you try to bargain with a Trade Manager NPC, 5 energy will be used for each attempt.

• Hiring WorkersEnergy is consumed for watching the different workers available for hire at a Work Supervisor NPC, and for hiring one.

➤ You can read more about this in the [Workers] page.

• Checking Trade PricesEnergy is consumed when checking trade prices from the World Map screen and Order Contract window.

• Node InvestmentYou can invest energy in a node to increase its level.Increasing an invested node’s level will increase the item drop rate from the monsters within that area.

➤ You can read more about this in the [Node] page.

• Black Market’s Secret ShopYou must use energy every time you want to see a new item offered in Patrigio’s secret shop.The selling price of the items it offers in his secret shop is not constant, and you do not know which item they will offer to sell you, but they sometimes sell rare or useful items.Keep in mind that the price they ask for the item might be above what one can pay for it in the Central Market.

• Energy PotionsThanks to certain characters in the world of Black Desert, such as Alustin (Velia), Purajin (Valencia City), and Celphie (O’draxxia), you can bottle up your excess energy for later use.These energy potions can also be sold to other Adventurers via the Central Market.




If you use all of your energy points and then wait for a bit, you will see you start recovering them.As a renewable resource, if you do not use your energy whenever you can, it’s as if you misuse the time you’re given in which you could use energy that otherwise remains refilled but unused. However, if your maximum amount of energy is higher, whenever you use it, it will take longer to refill all of it, so you won’t have to think as much about its constant use.

Since energy is useful in so many ways, increasing your maximum energy pool is greatly beneficial.You can increase your maximum energy pool by completing knowledge categories.

Not all knowledge categories will increase your maximum energy, so please check them before attempting to complete them. You can check which ones do by looking at the Knowledge screen (hotkey: H).





In the examples above, you can see that completed categories increase your maximum energy by a certain amount, usually a few points each.Every time you complete a knowledge category, the game will notify you on the upper part of your screen by saying which category was completed and how much your maximum energy pool has been increased for.




When beginning your journey in Black Desert’s world, an Adventurer starts off with only a maximum of 30 energy points.

You won’t be able to converse with NPCs, gather many items, or even reach level 2 when investing in nodes with that amount of energy.Since 1 energy point is replenished every 3 minutes, you may wish to wait for it to refill so you can use them again, but for example, it won’t be possible to view items at the secret shop, as each item viewed requires 50 energy. Veterans Adventurers will often recommend taking certain steps to increase your maximum energy pool in the early stages of your adventure.Increasing your maximum energy pool mostly involves gaining knowledge entries, which can be obtained by discovering new areas, conversing with NPCs, defeating monsters, and completing quests.

You can check the various knowledge categories in the Knowledge screen.Filling up the list of entries in most given categories will increase your maximum energy pool.Since most categories will only require 2/3 of the list to be filled up, if your goal is to increase your energy pool rather than collecting all available knowledge, it is rather doable.



Collecting entries and filling up the different categories in the Knowledge screen (hotkey: H) can be an enjoyable goal to pursue should you wish to do so.


◈ Acquiring Island Knowledge
One of the easier ways to increase your maximum energy pool is to gain entries through NPCs and locations.Most highlighted NPCs give an entry just by meeting them, and you can easily acquire the entries about the world’s topography naturally while you journey doing quests.

However, there are knowledge entries that you can’t acquire unless you are actively trying to get them, and those of islands are some of them.Unless an Adventurer is fishing or has a questline that asks to visit them, there aren’t that many reasons for them to visit the many islands in the archipelago north of the continent. Thus, those that focus on combat quests, trade, and other life skill activities rather than fishing will often find the sea areas of their world map still covered in a dark fog.

If you would, however, like to increase your maximum energy pool to its full potential, then it is a good idea to start this objective by preparing a ship. If you find a fishing boat too expensive, a rowboat will suffice, though be warned that they’re quite slow.
Additionally, if you play through a season with a season character, you can obtain a challenge reward for reaching Lv. 56 that will eventually lead you to acquire a 7-day Splat Fisher’s Clothes costume. You can equip this costume to quickly swim to all the islands.

If you have your transportation ready, you can embark on your exploration voyage. You can sail from Velia, Port Epheria, or any other place with a wharf on the coast, such as Altinova.While at sea, explore every island you come across, acquire any topographical knowledge you can find, go to the node manager on each island, and talk to them in order to gain their entry. In some cases, they will be necessary to unlock the island’s entry as well.

Just by doing this, you’ll be able to easily increase your maximum energy pool by 30~40 points.



Islands of various sizes dot the seas north of Velia. The potential maximum energy pool you can gain here is considerably large.


◈ Acquiring Topography and Character Knowledge
If you have found all of the islands, the next step is to acquire knowledge entries in towns and villages.Most NPCs dwell within towns, but some roam the landscape or require specific conditions to be met in order to gain access to the entries they hold, so it’s not that easy to acquire them.

If your objective is to increase your maximum energy as fast as possible, it is recommended that you get the knowledge you can and move to the next town quickly.

When acquiring the topography and character entries in a town, it is better to get the topography ones out of the way first. After gaining knowledge on the topography in a town, you can open your world map (hotkey: M) and right-click on the node to locate the node manager, reducing your chances of getting lost while looking for them.

If you are about to give up looking for the topography entry, try talking with NPCs near the town.By increasing your amity with them, you can sometimes acquire the topography knowledge without having to move around. This does take a lot of effort, so do this as a last resort.



The picture on the right shows that you need to meet another character before you can acquire the knowledge entry for this one. The name of the NPC you need to find will be highlighted in yellow in their dialogue text.

◈ Acquiring Ecology Knowledge
First open the Knowledge screen and check the Ecology category. All knowledge about monsters you have gathered so far will be listed there.

When you expand the different categories, those that are marked 'Increase Energy by 2/2 [Obtained]’ in color blue indicate that you have gained all available entries in that category and you cannot fill it any further.You should instead look at the categories marked in white, those that tell you the energy increase is at 0/2 or 1/2. There will be some entries within those categories that will show up in question marks ('??????' or '?????????') that need to be filled. You can move to the appropriate monster zone to fill up the category.

There are certain buffs obtained from equipment items and consumables that will increase your chance to get an entry when defeating monsters, but they’re not an absolute requirement.


◈ [Tip] Useful Information about territorial ecology knowledge
You can also acquire monster knowledge through gathering, from things such as collecting meat from a boar, or mining for ore from a stoneback crab.

Balenos- Cox Pirates: To acquire their knowledge, you must be at around level 55 and have the appropriate enhanced equipment for the area.

◈ Acquiring Adventure Journals/Academics Knowledge
When you have gathered some topography, character, and ecology knowledge entries, it is now time to look at the adventure journals and academics sections.It is possible to gather these knowledge entries naturally while traveling around Black Desert’s world together with the black spirit, but much knowledge is hidden.

You can discover these hidden entries through the following methods.

• Quests
When you veer away from the path the black spirit takes you on, and just go around meeting NPCs at your leisure and doing their quests, you can acquire many adventure journal entries.They are the record of the journey an Adventurer has experienced.



Finishing quests may sometimes award you a knowledge entry.

• Conversing with NPCs
There are many NPCs in Black Desert who each have their own stories.If you meet an NPC for the first time, try to speak to them first. By checking your amity with them on the upper left side of the screen, you can check what kind of stories this NPC will tell you when you become friendly with them.The process of increasing amity might be difficult at times, but considering the maximum energy gain obtained, and if you enjoy learning their stories, it definitely is worthwhile to check out.



You can acquire the Velian Bookshelf knowledge entry once you reach at least 100 amity with Sealus, the furniture dealer in the town of Velia.

• Interacting With ObjectsIf you see a stone statue, or a bookcase, get close to it and try to interact with it if possible.Many knowledge entries of these categories are waiting to be discovered by Adventurers all throughout the world. Sometimes they may be easily identified, like the above examples. Other times they may be better hidden, like the view of the entry to a cave telling you rumors about it.
Some NPCs’ interests for conversation to earn amity with them require entries of these types, so collecting them is considered important.



As seen in the image, at times you can obtain entries from specific objects in the world.


◈ [Tip] Useful Information regarding Adventure Journals / Academics
Try the Calpheon and Valkyries category which raises energy by 7 for completing it.It looks difficult to finish because this one theme has many knowledge entries in it, but it is one of the easiest topics to complete because most of them can be acquired simply by reading books in the library of the Holy College of Calpheon City.

However, in order to get the entry A Talk with Elion, you must activate and complete the quest A Talk with Elion from priestess Annolisa Rosie, at the same location. This quest can be done after finishing the quest Balker’s Idol from Balker Batian.

If you want to gain adventure journal and academic knowledge entries, you can’t just focus on talking to NPCs or simply doing quests, but need to try to acquire it through all kinds of sources.
You may get tired if you just solely focus on hunting for knowledge entries to increase your maximum energy pool. It will naturally go up during your journey throughout the world, so you might want to focus on improving your character first. After you’re happy with that, check what entries you’re missing and gradually work on acquiring them.

A word of advice - Rather than thinking that you must finish everything within a day, the gathering of information, and reading about each knowledge entry embedded in the game as you get to know Black Desert’s world in your own unique way, will truly allow you to enjoy it much more.

Subtópico: Knowledge
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
As seen above, each category completed will grant you an increase to maximum energy. Categories completed are labeled in blue, and have [Obtained] to their right.Uncompleted categories are labeled in white, as seen by the People of Calpheon one.
Please note that categories can only be made visible in the Knowledge screen once you’ve obtained your first entry about them. That means that you won’t see a category unless you get at least one entry that pertains to them.

Certain types of knowledge, such as those of monsters in the Ecology section, are graded. The effects of knowing about something is different depending on the topic, and the higher the grade, the better effects you’re provided.

When you do not possess any knowledge of an enemy monster, you will only see its health bar change color from yellow (full health), then orange, to finally red (near defeated). Once you obtain knowledge about them, you’ll be able to see their health bar deplete during combat.

Possessing the knowledge entries of characters, monsters, events and topics of all kinds is helpful when you strike a conversation with NPCs to increase your amity with them. To increase the grade of monster knowledge, continue defeating them and there is a chance you will obtain a higher grade of its entry. When obtained, knowledge of a better grade automatically replaces that of a lower grade of the same topic.

For certain enemies, you will need to delete the current knowledge entry and earn it again. You can delete knowledge entries through the NPC Annolisa Rosie at the Holy College of Calpheon.


As seen above, if you go to Annolisa Rosie at the Holy College of Calpheon you can delete acquired knowledge or use a completed category to make a bookshelf with that knowledge.

Please be aware that crafting a bookshelf from a knowledge category will delete all the earned entries from that category, as they’re transformed into the bookshelf you obtain.



You can delete a knowledge entry by selecting it from the knowledge management window. Deleting an entry consumes 10 energy.


Knowledge is overall divided into 9 main categories, with each category being subdivided into a different number of sections and smaller categories.Depending on the topic, the maximum energy increase that can be obtained when completing it differs significantly.

Like with deleting entries explained above, Annalisa Rosie also provides the service to craft bookshelves. Entries are taken randomly from a completed category, used to create a bookshelf, and then deleted from your Knowledge screen.

The created bookshelf can be used 10 times, with a cooldown period of 1 hour between each use.
These bookshelves can also be sold through the Central Market.
• Character: This knowledge is categorized into territory and type.You can get many of these entries by simply talking to the different NPCs throughout the world, but keep in mind that obtaining the ones for certain NPCs will require more than just that.Some will require you to advance through the main questline of a territory, or to befriend a different NPC first. They’ll let you know about the requirement with a yellow text.

• Topography & Sea: This knowledge is categorized by territory.You will automatically get most of these entries when you explore the world on your journey, but some of them can be obtained only through conversation with an NPC.Some may require you to befriend an amity by raising your amity with them. Others might simply ask you to spend a bit of your character’s energy, or complete a quest to obtain it.

• Ecology: This category is made up of the monster knowledge of each territory.
You can earn these entries at a certain chance when you defeat them.
You can raise this chance via the different buffs and features available that indicate “Knowledge Gain Chance +X%” for a higher chance to get an entry, and “Higher Grade Knowledge Gain Chance +X%” for a higher chance to get a better entry than the one you already possess (for example, a B grade entry of a monster if you already possess the C one).

As you learn Ecology entries, you will begin to accumulate ecology points, which net you additional item drop rate percentage. You can see these points in the main Knowledge screen.

• Adventure Journal: You can get these entries mainly during quests, as their reward, and while interacting with objects in the world. You can also unlock many of them from NPCs you befriend. • Academics: This category deals mainly with background details of the world: The people’s culture, their religions, history, and politics.It is similar to Adventure Journal, and its entries can be obtained in the same ways.

• Life Skill: These entries encompass all life skill activities in Black Desert’s world aside from those of trade goods. Certificates that allow you to process further materials, gathered items, cooking dishes, alchemy elixirs, fish obtained, processed materials, and more.They are earned when the item related to the entry is acquired, usually from the related life skill activity employed to obtain the item. In some cases they’re given as quest rewards or via NPC conversation.
Compared to the previous categories, this one and the ones below do not reward you with an increase to maximum energy when they are completed. • Learning the Ropes of Black Desert: This category covers various topics considered basics of the game, such as class Awakening story entries, certain special NPCs, Fughar’s basics on the various content features, and more. • Trade: These entries are about the different trade goods once available for trade within the world. You can get them by talking with the Trade Manager NPCs in every city.

◈ Getting Knowledge
As explained previously, a category will open and appear within the Knowledge screen only when you obtain your first entry included in it.The entries you haven’t obtained yet show up as question marks, and if you hover your cursor over them, you can see some simple hints that will guide you toward acquiring them.Certain entries also offer hints that can be earned by offering a drink to some NPCs in inns and taverns throughout the world.

Additionally, the chance to gain a knowledge entry is the same no matter what your character level is. A high level character can obtain the entry of a low level monster.
• Conversing with NPCs: If you talk to an NPC with an exclamation mark above its head, you’ll get the character’s entry. Some NPCs offer more entries than just their own when approaching them. These might require you to spend a bit of character energy to acquire them, or to befriend the NPC by raising your amity with them.

Keep in mind that some entries are provided by nameless NPCs without exclamation marks, such as soldiers or villagers, so be sure to speak with all NPCs you encounter at least once.
• Quest Reward: During some quests you can earn entries. This can happen during the quest either coincidentally or because the quest asks you to obtain them, or as part of a quest’s reward.

• Exploration: You will get topography & sea entries when you discover new areas of the world.

• Life Skill Activity: You can gain certain life skill entries at a chance when you perform life activities such as gathering, fishing, or hunting, for example.

• Production: When you produce a new item by preparing a cooking dish, synthesizing an alchemical elixir, or processing a material, you will always earn their entry.

• Hunting: You have the chance to get monster entries when you defeat them.

• Objects: Objects that serve as node managers will give you node manager entry when you interact with them. You can also get entries from books and all types of objects found throughout the world, such as writing on a wall, a campfire, an armor stand, and many more.
This refers to the knowledge topic that an NPC is interested in, and it is the topic you talk about when you have a conversation with them. These only show on the NPCs that you can have conversation with, and if you do not possess a minimum amount of entries about the topic the NPC is interested in, you can’t have a conversation with them.

An NPC’s interests are displayed when you go close enough to them and see a small circle, or within their interaction screen in the Interest Knowledge Status window to the left.
Through a conversation with an NPC, you can earn amity. The more amity you have with them, the friendlier they will act. In many cases, a certain amity amount is required for them to give you further entries.

➤ You can read more about this topic in the [Amity] page.
You can get hints about knowledge entries that you haven’t acquired yet by visiting a tavern or inn in towns such as Velia and Heidel.

If you talk to certain NPCs after purchasing a Dark Beer from the innkeeper NPC, you can get hints about the whereabouts of undiscovered knowledge entries.
On your character’s profile (hotkey: P) you will see four types of family fame: combat fame, life fame, special fame, and overall family fame.

The special fame of your family of characters is calculated from the accumulated knowledge and contribution points of all your characters.

Increasing the different types of fame will reward you with a daily silver allowance sent to the Black Spirit’s Safe (hotkey: B).

Contribution Point Rental Items
​​​​​​​
There is a wide variety of items that you can rent using Contribution Points.

Here is a list of items you can rent:
Equipment, used for fighting; Gathering Tool, used for gathering materials; Fence, used to grow crops; Container, used to access storage; Matchlock, flute, or small drum, used to play mini games and/or fulfill quests.

The most useful item to rent using contribution points for rookies would be Equipment.

The rental equipment offer great AP and DP, and don’t need to repairs because all rental equipment can’t lose durability. The only downside is that they cannot be enhanced and they are quite heavy.

If you’re not going to use the rented item, you can return it to the NPC and get your Contribution Points back.

▲ You can use a fixed amount of Contribution Points to rent good equipment.

If you’ve already met the NPC who lends you the item, you can search for the item in the NPC Search menu located on the top right corner of the screen, next to the minimap.
If you move your mouse onto the list, you can see the item and its information.

▲ If you’ve already met a NPC who lends you the item, you can just search for it on the NPC Search menu.

Contribution Point rental items – Equipment
Contribution Point Equipment is useful for a rookie starting their adventure in Black Desert.

It doesn’t lose durability and you also have a variety to choose from since they offer different item effects.

You can see which NPC lends you the equipment just by reading the equipment’s name.
The equipment has the NPC’s name you rent from as part of its name.
The only exception would be the Kaia Equipment set.
You can rent Kaia main weapons from Kanobas and Kaia armors from Dobart in Calpheon.
Kaia Equipment is the most expensive costing 50 Contribution Points to rent but they are good enough to be used in the Calpheon and Mediah Region.

You can also check where the NPC is located using the NPC Search function on the top right corner of the screen, next to the minimap.

Contribution Point rental items – Others
You can rent other items using Contribution Points like, a fence to grow crops, or a matchlock to complete quests.

The ‘Container’ allows you to access the storage of a town you rented it from.
You can place the Container in a residence you own and use it there.

But you can only store and take out things of the storage. You won’t be able to use any of the other Storage Keeper NPC’s functions or the Marketplace. You can rent a container by giving 10 Contribution Points to a Storage Keeper NPC in town.

▲ You can rent a container using 10 contribution points from the Storage Keeper in town.
​​​​​​​
▲ Select [Place Mode] in the residence you’ve purchased.

▲ In [Place Mode], select the container in the furniture list and place it in the residence.

▲ When you open the container, you can see which town’s storage you are using.

You can also rent a ‘Fence’ using Contribution Points. A fence allows you to grow crops that can be used for cooking, alchemy, and crafting.
The fence has multiple types and each allows you to grow a different number of crops at a time: Small Fence, Plain Fence, and Strong Fence
A Small Fence allows you to grow 4 crops at a time, Plain Fence allows you to grow 7 crops at a time, and Strong Fence allows you to grow 10 crops at a time.

You cannot rent multiple fences if a fence is present in your character’s inventory. However, if it is anywhere else like in storage, mount storage, or install on the ground, you can rent more. You can install up to 10 fences at a time.

If you have enough contribution points you should rent Strong Fences. It will allow you to plant the most crops since the number of fences you can install is limited.

▲ You can rent fences from certain NPCs.

▲ This is what an installed fence looks like.

You can rent a ‘Matchlock’ using Contribution Points to carry out certain quests or to earn Knowledge.

You can’t hit other characters or monsters with the rented Matchlock, but you can shoot birds in the air or jellyfishes floating on water.

You have to use a matchlock to complete certain quests and learn Ecological Knowledge. So eventually you would get to use one.


▲You can use a Practice Matchlock to shoot down birds in the air. You can only learn ecological knowledge by killing animals with a matchlock.

You can rent a flute or a small drum using Contribution Points, they allow you to a play minigames. Equip it on the Weapon Slot and to play the mini game and finish quests.

▲ The flute lets you play the minigame where you have to avoid the falling notes.
​​​​​​​
▲ You can play a minigame using the Small Drum as well.






Subtópico: Contribution
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
Contribution is a numerical value that indicates how much you’ve contributed to each of the different territories of the world. This is represented in the game as contribution points, a single number that shows your total contribution, regardless of the territory you’ve assisted.
You can better understand it as your family’s fame among the different inhabitants of the world.

You can use your earned contribution mainly to invest in nodes, purchase houses, and rent special items such as garden fences. Contribution points are easy to invest, but difficult to earn. Thankfully, they’re not permanently spent. Investments you make with these points can be taken back, refilling the number of points available for investment. However, it might get tiring to keep track of and manage all your already invested points when you suddenly need them for another reason, so make sure to plan carefully what you want them invested into. Please remember that you cannot have rented items on characters you want to delete. Thus, if you desire to delete a character item, you must return the rented item to the appropriate NPC. Otherwise, the game won’t allow you to delete the character.



The main ways to earn contribution experience are as follows: • Quest RewardThe most common way; most quests in Black Desert reward contribution experience. If you carry out many quests throughout the world, you will see your contribution points quickly rise.

Regarding repeatable quests, they’re devised to be short and efficient; a consistent method to acquire contribution experience. You will see that various of the main cities of the game have so-called quest circuits to earn contribution experience on a daily basis. You can find these quests in the Recurring tab of the Quest window (hotkey: O).
• ExplorationWhen you explore the world and find a new area of the game for the first time, you will earn a bit of contribution experience alongside obtaining the area’s knowledge entry.Because there are a lot of areas to discover in the world of Black Desert, the obtained contribution experience quickly piles up.

• Gateway Node DefenseWhen you’re traveling at night, you might encounter raid parties of monsters assaulting a gateway node, usually a fortified camp. Assisting the nearby soldiers and defeating the monsters will reward you with regional defense tokens, which you can give to certain NPCs in each territory to earn contribution experience.However, keep in mind that exchanging these tokens for contribution experience consumes energy, so be wary of not consuming it all in one go.

Contribution points are essential for determined life skill activities, like when you are required to task items be crafted in town workshops or when you need a rented item to progress. Moreover, they’re also incredibly useful for new Adventurers, as they allow for the rental of powerful equipment pieces with no prior requirement.

Contribution points can be used largely in three cases: when you want to invest in a node, when you want to purchase a house, and when you want to rent an item. • Node InvestmentA node network starts from any main town or city, those represented with a blue icon in your world map. You don’t need to invest in these towns to activate them. From these locations you can invest contribution points in adjacent nodes to spread your network.

If you invest in nodes and make connections throughout the land, you will be able to carry out trading between towns and other locations as you go back and forth between the connected nodes.If you sell a trade good to a city from a node not connected to your network, its sale price will drop to 30% of the original cost, so you will want to connect the nodes before you start trading.

If you invest contribution points in a node, you can also invest in its production nodes, satellite nodes that belong to the node you first invested in. If you invest points in one of these production nodes, you can send workers from surrounding towns to work there and mainly extract resources for you.

Step 1. Check the node that is connected in a white line with a town.
• HousesYou can use contribution points to purchase houses in towns. These purchased houses have a variety of uses: As your personal residence which you can decorate the interior of as you want, as storage space to expand your town’s storage, as lodging for workers you’ve hired, and even as workshops you can send workers to with the purpose of processing or crafting various new items from basic items you have stockpiled in the town storage.

When you click on a town in the World Map screen, many icons of houses will appear. Like with nodes, you may need to purchase houses in sequential order, connecting them.
The houses you can purchase are shown in blue.Houses shown in gray cannot be purchased, which means you need to acquire other nearby houses first to unlock them.Houses shown in white have already been acquired. You can see what they’re being used as by the small symbol in the lower right part of the house icon. In the example above you can see all the obtained houses are being used for storage. If you click on a blue house icon, a window pops up to let you select for what purpose you will use the house. Each house has different options, but most houses can be used as storage units and residences.

A house used as a storage will expand the maximum amount of usable storage slots in the town the house is in or linked to, while one used as a residence is used as your personal home for you to decorate the interior of.
Click a blue house, select its purpose, and then press Purchase. As seen in the example above, the purchase of houses requires contribution points, and a small amount of silver.

➤ You can read more about this in the [Workers] and [Houses] pages.
• Item RentalThere are many kinds of items that can be rented with contribution; from equipment items useful for new Adventurers, garden fences you can install in the field and where you can grow crops, containers that allow you to access the town’s storage from your residence, a matchlock for hunting beginners, a flute used for certain quests, and more. You can quickly identify and search for them thanks to the [CP] tag they have in front of them. Example: [CP] Strong Fence. For new Adventurers who start the game for the first time, we recommend various equipment pieces for rental that will complement their progress. Although these pieces cannot be enhanced and are somewhat heavy, compared to normal equipment, they have excellent AP or DP, consume no durability and need no repair. They’re a good temporary addition to your character if you have yet to complete its PEN (V) Naru set.

If you no longer need the equipment piece, return the rented item to the NPC that leased it to you to take back the contribution points you spent on it.

• Node InvestmentOpen the World Map screen and click the node from which you want to retrieve your investment. Press the Withdraw Contribution button that appears on the left window. This will uninvest the node. However, if the node you want to retrieve the investment from is in the middle of a connection between different dependent nodes, you will need to retrieve the investment from other nodes first. Essentially, you cannot cut a node network from a town to a certain node by the middle of it.

Additionally, keep in mind that any energy previously consumed to level up a node (up to Lv. 20) will be returned.
If you want to sell a house in the middle of a chain of buildings, you will need to first sell all the other houses connected to that one. In the example above, to sell the house Heidel 8-1, Room 1, first you must sell rooms 2 to 4. The window will offer the possibility of selling all of them all at once if you desire so, or sell them individually.

When you sell a house, you will be returned your contribution points, but not the silver spent for changes carried out for their designated purpose and possible upgrades.

Additionally, if the house was being used as a residence, all installed items within it will be automatically moved to the town’s storage.


Please remember that any wallpaper and flooring installed on your house will be permanently deleted upon selling the residence, as they’re one-use items, and won’t reappear upon purchasing it again.

Subtópico: Nodes
Conteúdo do Subtópico:

Nodes are an essential factor in trading and other life skill activities.The world of Black Desert is divided into a determined number of nodes that every Adventurer has to discover on their own. These nodes can be connected between them, and once connected allow for a variety of interconnected features.This network of connected nodes lets you trade between distant lands with no penalty, send workers to gather natural resources found in each area presided over by a node, and increase the item drop rate of valuable loot from monsters.
In order to connect nodes, you need to invest contribution points to activate them. These points are obtained by assisting the inhabitants of the different territories of the world.

➤ You can read more about contribution points and how to obtain them in the [Contribution] page. When different towns are connected via a node network, the silver cost  of transporting items between is reduced. If you transport items between unconnected towns, the silver cost is tripled.In a similar manner, you can sell trade goods to trade managers throughout the world regardless of nodes being connected or not, however, you will suffer a penalty reducing the sale price of the trade good for 30% of its value if the nodes between the area you obtained the trade item in and the sale area are not connected.
Additionally, when you’re sending your workers to craft items in your acquired town workshops, you can see that certain workers have “Not Connected” in red after their town in the list. For a worker in town A to take the materials from town A’s storage, go to town B, and craft an item there, both towns need to be connected via a node network.

➤ You can read more about workshop crafting in the [Crafting] page.
Nodes are largely divided into two categories: exploration nodes and production nodes. An exploration node is the first type of node you see in your world map, and depending on the features of the area they’re classified into one of six categories: City, Town, Trade, Gateway, Danger Zone, and Node.Cities and towns are always safe zones, while the rest are usually combat zones.In a safe zone you are not meant to be attacked by other Adventurers, and nearby guards will quickly dispatch any that attempt to. Opposite to them are combat zones, in which as the name indicates you are vulnerable to be attacked by others, both Adventurers and monsters. A production node is a satellite node tied to an exploration node. You can view them as subnodes.There are 5 types of production nodes: Farming & Gathering, Mining, Lumbering, Production, and Excavation. Each type lets you send workers to them to extract resources that are then deposited in a town storage. For example, a farming production node might specialize in potatoes, while a production one might specialize in chicken meat or fleece. The following is a list of the 6 types of exploration nodes and their uses:


In order to invest in exploration nodes you need to form networks. These start from any of the main cities and towns, such as Velia, Heidel, or Glish.All city nodes are unlocked automatically. Many town nodes are activated automatically, though some will require you to invest in them. All other nodes require contribution investment to be activated.

All nodes possess a non-player character (NPC) node manager that possesses the node management interface for you to interact with the node. For danger zones and simple nodes, there are cases where an object plays the role of the local node manager NPC.


You can invest in a node via its node manager.However, in order to invest in a node, you need to have discovered it first, and have it connected to an already active node, such as a city node or a node part of an existing active network. If you haven’t discovered the area, even if you meet the node manager the Node Management button in the interaction menu won’t show up.Node areas can be discovered in one of two ways: Either by simply exploring it until the game rewards you with its knowledge entry and unlocks its visibility in your world map, or by finding and interacting with the node manager of the area. In some cases the node manager NPC will ask you to consume energy to unlock the area’s knowledge entry and discovery.

If you select an unconnected node icon in your world map and press the Previous Node button to the left, light pillars will indicate all the nodes you can invest in and connect to the corresponding node you have selected. The nodes you have already invested in will not show up. At this point in time, if you haven’t discovered the nearby nodes, the indicated light pillar won’t be the location of those areas’ node managers, but the location where you can discover the area. After this, navigate to the location and discover it, and then find the node manager near the point.


Press Previous Node on the left to indicate the surrounding nodes you have not invested in.


★ Practice! Connect Velia and Heidel

The method to connect nodes might seem a bit complicated at first glance, but it's easy to understand once you’ve actually practiced it for the first time.For this example, let's connect two relatively close towns, Velia and Heidel.



Because you already have the knowledge of the Bartali Farm node adjacent to Velia, there is a white line between Velia and the farm.In this case, you can immediately go to the Bartali Farm node manager NPC, Emma Bartali, and invest in the node.



If there is a white line between two nodes, it means the adjacent node can be invested with contribution points and connected with each other immediately. Go to the Bartali Farm and find Emma Bartali, the node manager. Usually it isn’t hard to find a node manager because there is always a flag object around the NPC.


▲ As seen in the image above, you can see the flag behind Emma.


▲ While interacting with Emma Bartali, press the Node Management button (hotkey: 3).



If you press the Invest Contribution button on the screen that appears when you press the Node Management button, the investment will be made and the node will now be active.



Velia and Bartali Farm are now connected. An orange color will appear in connected nodes, both in a circle around the node and in the line connecting them.

When you invested contribution points in Bartali Farm, a connection was made between the city node of Velia and the trade node of Bartali Farm.

Now that the Bartali Farm and Balenos Forest nodes can be connected, a white line appears between the two.



The nodes of Bartali Farm and Balenos Forest are now available for connection.

The Balenos Forest node is managed by Daphne DelLucci, located in the DelLucci Farm. Since all local names and node names may not correspond exactly, refer to the node information displayed on the minimap at the top right part of the screen.In this case, the location of the node manager NPC is not directly within the Balenos Forest area, but it belongs to that node.



As seen above, the Balenos Forest node is managed by Daphne DelLucci from the DelLucci Farm. The way to activate the node is the same as when you activated the Bartali Farm node.Press the Node Management button and invest in the node with your contribution points. After this, you can see that a connection has been made between the Velia, Bartali Farm, and Balenos Forest nodes.



If you reach this connected node and find no white line stretching anywhere from it, it will mean you need to explore the surrounding area to find the nearest adjacent node. In this case, we recommend you walk south following the road from Velia until you find a border checkpoint.You’ve discovered the Heidel Pass node.

Invest in this new node like previously done on the other ones.



You can see Velia and Heidel Pass are now connected via the node network.

There is now only one node with a white line connected to Heidel Pass. It is the Northern Guard Camp node, located just north of Heidel. If you activate this node, the two towns will be connected to each other in a node network.

When you connect nodes like this, as you move between Velia and Heidel, you can buy and sell trade goods sold by the traders located in each town and the different nodes along the route.If the nodes are not connected to each other, when you sell trade goods you will receive a 30% silver cost penalty. With connected nodes you receive the full silver price according to the current trade market prices.

You can send hired workers to gather natural resources for you in the connected nodes, of course only once you’ve invested in their production nodes.



In the image above you can see that you can send workers from Velia, the closest town to one of the Bartali Farm production nodes, to gather resources. In this case, it will gather chicken meat, and each work cycle will take around 40 minutes.



If you have already acquired the knowledge entry about a node and know its location in the world, but you do not know the correct order to connect it to other nodes because the white line does not appear, select the node and press the Previous Node button on the left side of the screen.



If you want to activate the Western Guard Camp, what should you do?



Select the Western Guard Camp Node, then press the Previous Node button on the left.



The surrounding nodes that can connect to the Western Guard Camp are all displayed with light pillars. Trace the way to an already connected node and you’ll be able to connect the guard camp with no problem.


A production node is a satellite node, or subnode, that belongs to an exploration node.



If you invest in a production node, you can send workers to gather resources at the location.From the example above, if you invest in a potato farm node you can obtain potatoes, while investing in a chicken meat production node will yield you chicken meat.



Invest contribution points to activate a production node, and then you can command your hired workers to travel to the location and gather resources. You can hire workers through contracts in a town with a work supervisor, and the initial number of workers you can hire per town is one. You can increase the number of workers that can be employed in a given town by purchasing houses and using them for worker lodging.
Items gathered and crafted by workers are deposited in the town storage the worker is from.Example: if you send a worker from Velia, in the territory of Balenos, to gather fleece in a node in the territory of Serendia, the gathered fleece will be stored in Velia’s town storage.When a town storage is full, a worker will stop working, and you won’t be able to send them to gather more to any node unless empty space is made in the town storage.

Once workers reach Lv. 40, you can decide in which town storage they’ll deposit the items they harvest from the production node, allowing you to better organize space.

Additionally, note that the luck of certain types of workers may allow them to bring back not only the expected listed items from a production node, but also extra items, depending on the type of production node. For example, a worker laboring at a farm might bring back a farmer’s sack, which when opened will reward you with a fruit, a useful ingredient for alchemy.

➤ You can read more about this feature in the [Workers] page.


You can retrieve your investment from nodes easily. Open your world map, click on an invested node, and press the Withdraw Contribution button on the left.However, if a node is part of a network and isn’t located at an end of it, it won’t be possible to disconnect the node. The Withdraw Contribution button will not appear in this case.In situations like this one, you will need to find the closest end of the network and start disconnecting nodes from it until you reach the node you want to retrieve the investment from.



In the image above, you cannot retrieve the investment from the Forest of Plunder node. You will only be able to do this when you’ve disconnected the node at the end of that network, in this case the Goblin Cave node.

The text highlighted above will warn you that either the node you want to disconnect is tied to two or more nodes in a network, as explained above, or that you have production nodes invested in on that node. In those cases, first retrieve the investment from a production node and then you’ll be able to retrieve it from the exploration node. If a worker is on the node at the moment, either wait for them to finish or cancel their activity there.



On the world map, pressing the  icon will show you the most efficient way of connecting between Nodes that you have unlocked.

Subtópico: Storage
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
Town storages in Black Desert are separate for each town.For example, items that are left at Velia’s storage can’t be recovered from Heidel’s.Additionally, not all towns have the storage functionality.To distinguish this, open the World Map interface (hotkey: M) and press on a town’s node icon. If the town has a storage, the storage window will appear right away, while towns without one will show nothing.Because of this, the NPCs who manage the towns’ storages are highlighted and easily found.You can find the different storage keepers easily by clicking the Find NPC magnifying glass icon to the left of the minimap and using the function, or you can open the world map and search for the storage keeper icon in towns and cities.

The storage keeper NPCs are the following.

After getting a house in an area, if you set its usage as storage, you can get more town storage slots for the town the house is in, or for the nearest town if the house is for example in a farm.

Keep in mind that items that are bound to the character can’t be moved to a town storage.

Once an item is in the storage it cannot be stolen or disappear.However, for items that have a price guarantee (such as fish) or an expiration date (such as certain summon scroll and event items), they can decay or expire even if they’re inside a town’s storage, so make sure to remember which items like that you’ve stored.

Below the storage slots you will find a good reference of the value of the items you have stored in that town.
You will then see two tabs, Status and Send.

The Status tab will let you see the status of all current transport taking place, both for the town you’re in or have selected and overall for all transport around the world.
The interface will update you on the number of available wagons, the weight limit of the wagon you’re loading with items at the moment, and the number of available inventory slots it has.

It will also detail the silver transport fee that you’ll be charged for sending the wagon.If both towns, the one you’re sending items from, and the one receiving the items, are connected via the node system, the transport fee will be cheap, but if not, the transport fee is tripled, though it is good to let you know this amount is symbolic at best.

If you have prepared everything, press the Send button at the bottom and the transport will be queued.

After this, all you have to do is wait. Freight wagons or trade ships that are constantly moving throughout the world will pick up the items when they reach the town they’re in and move them to the town you have selected. As it is a real time procedure, it will take time for it to be completed.

Later on, meet the storage keeper NPC in the destination town and check the status of the transport. If the items have already arrived, you can find them in the transport status right away.If you press Get All at this point, all of the items that have been sent will be deposited in the destination town’s storage.
Ever since Adventurers have begun delving into the mysterious realm of the abyss, and structure at its center, it has become possible to more easily, and cheaply, move items between storages.

Due to most cities being connected to the Magnus, you can now move and store items to the storage of other territories, remotely. You can move and store items from your inventory to storages in different territories through the storage keeper NPCs.

This functionality is unlocked territory by territory, gradually, as you proceed with the main questline of the Magnus.
If you talk to a storage keeper NPC and press the Currency Exchange option, their NPC shop window will appear, and in it one can purchase and sell gold bars.

Gold bars are required for several features, such as exchanges with certain NPCs for their services. Many quests will also reward you with gold bars, which can have their value transferred to usable silver here.

Keep in mind that the purchase and sale of gold bars is not equal in value, and there is a difference of 0,001% of their value given as interest to the storage keeper when purchasing gold bars from them. For example, purchasing a gold bar valued in 100,000 silver will cost you 100,100 silver, as seen below with the Gold Bar 1G item.
Additionally, you can see that certain workers have “Not Connected” in red after their town in the list. For a worker in Altinova to take the materials from Altinova’s storage, go to Eilton, and craft the bench there, both towns need to be connected via the node system.

You can read more about this feature in the [Node] and [Crafting] pages.

Subtópico: Traveler's Horse
Conteúdo do Subtópico:


Subtópico: Mount
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
The horse is the representative mount of Black Desert, and is the dream of all adventurers. A high tier horse has amazing movement speed, allowing you to run to far places quickly.
Horse tiers go from tier 1 (T1) to tier (T10), and as the tier goes higher, the basic potential of the horse’s stats improves (speed, acceleration, turn, braking). Like other mounts, a horse can earn skills as it levels up. Every time the level of the horse goes up, there is a chance to obtain a skill. This can happen up to Lv. 30. After this level, the horse will continue leveling up, but its stats won’t increase any further and it won’t earn any new skill.Horses can level up at Lv. 100. Leveling up past Lv. 30 serves as a protective measure. Monsters below a horse’s level won’t attack it. Skills such as sprint, instant acceleration and drift allow a horse to run faster, so they’re highly valued compared to other skills, which is reflected in their sale price in the horse market.
They also can have equipment put on them to increase their stats and allow for mounted combat and increased base movement speed. This equipment varies by quality, and depending on the type, can be purchased from stable keepers, from the Central Market, or can be crafted in a horse gear workshop.

Horses can be tamed in the wild, and can also be purchased in the horse market.

➤ You can read more about horses in the [Training] page.
The donkey is a mount that specializes in carrying goods rather than moving fast.
It can carry more weight (LT) than a horse and has good endurance, so it’s useful when starting to trade.

This mount can be leveled up to Lv. 15, and can obtain up to 7 unique skills.

Fwuzzy alpaca cannot be equipped with defense gear.

Camels are useful when traversing the Great Desert of Valencia, more commonly known as the Black Desert. Where most horses and wagons will have their movement speed reduced, a camel can freely move without any movement speed penalty.

They can be equipped with horse gear, and their stats will increase as they level up.

Aside from the previously mentioned quest reward, there are two types of camels that can be obtained, both with the same method. You can exchange x5 Golden Seal - [Imperial Training] for a light brown camel, the same camel from the quest, and x15 Golden Seal - [Imperial Training] for a deep brown camel, a better camel stats-wise.

This is useful to remember in the case you ever lose the camel you obtained from the quest and require one to complete any type of content the game offers, such as an Adventure Log journal page.
A miniature elephant is said to be the wagon of the desert. It has a good weight limit capacity, and thus is useful when you need to carry and transport trade goods across the Valencian desert.

The same stable keeper that will reward you with a camel in Sand Grain Bazaar will have a quest, The Adorable and Trusty Porter, Miniature Elephant, also at Lv. 55, to put you in the correct path to obtain a miniature elephant.

Once a certain questline has been completed, you will be rewarded with the mount. This questline can be done once per character.
If you want to obtain additional miniature elephants with the same character, the Valencian mogul Shakatu will offer you the way to do so.

Equipment for miniature elephants can be crafted in various workshops around the world, with the best available gear crafted in Stonetail Horse Ranch and Duvencrune.
A wagon is a mount that specializes in carrying a large amount of items, and is mainly used for trading and training horses.

It has the most slots out of all ground mounts, and even if the weight limit of the mount is exceeded, the original base speed does not significantly slow down.

You can connect horses to the wagon, with the number depending on the type of wagon, up to a maximum of 4 horses. This helps train the horses as well, and makes the wagon serve in this way the double purpose of both trading and training.

The movement speed of a wagon is not particularly fast, even with high grade equipment, and the individual horses’ movement speed do not contribute to the wagon’s.

Instead of health, wagons possess durability. You can’t fix most wagons’ durability, but they’re made with a high amount of it to undertake many journeys. Do keep in mind that when durability runs out, the movement speed will be drastically reduced.
While the most basic of wagons, seen above, can be purchased from a stable keeper, better ones need to be crafted at a workshop, with the best of them, the forest path wagon, requiring a considerable amount of dedication to obtain it.

Wagons you can purchase from stable keepers include the flimsy wagon, shabby wagon, and farm wagon.

Wagons that you must craft on your own at a workshop, or purchase from the Central Market, include the strong wagon, trade wagon, white wagon, merchant wagon, noble wagon, and forest path wagon. The same applies for their equipment.

The last one, together with its equipment, can only be crafted in the elven capital of Grána.


◈ Ship
Different types of boats can be obtained both for navigating inland rivers and the open seas.

A ship is a necessary mount when you want to enjoy ocean content such as hotspot fishing, bartering,  hunting sea monsters, and doing quests around the various islands.

Out of all the available boats, there are those that require a workshop to craft them and can be purchased from the Central Market, and those that need a previously existing boat to be upgraded. The more basic boats have a fixed amount of durability, and when all of it runs out you must discard the mount. You can get a little bit of money when discarding a boat like this.

Better vessels, starting with sailboats, can have their durability repaired.

Boats you can purchase from a wharf manager include a raft and the Bartali sailboat from Proix in Velia.

Boats you can craft in a workshop include rafts, a few rowboats, fishing boats, two types of Epheria cogs, Epheria sailboats, and Epheria frigates. The latter two can only be crafted in Port Epheria.

Boats that can be upgraded include Bartali Sailboat, Epheria Sailboat, Epheria Frigate, Improved Epheria Sailboat, Improved Epheria Frigate, Epheria Caravel, Epheria Galleass, and the 4 types of Epheria Carrack.

➤ You can read more about how to upgrade these ships in the [Ship Upgrading] page.

The main difference between the two paths shown there is that sailboats, caravels, and the carracks obtained from upgrading them are custom made for trading, while frigates, galleasses, and the carracks obtained from upgrading them are custom made for sea combat.

Equipment for basic boats can be purchased from wharf managers, while equipment for better and improved boats needs to be crafted at workshops, mainly at Port Epheria and Iliya Island.

There are two types of guild mounts in Black Desert: galleys, and elephants.

The process to obtain them involves an entire guild’s effort, and their ownership resides with the guild, not you as an Adventurer.

They’re employed for node and territorial conquest wars, and as a useful method of transportation at sea.

➤ You can read more about them in the [Guild Mount] page.
Various mounts can learn and use skills.Other than the basic skills they may come with, when the level of a mount goes up, there is a chance it learns new skills.

For mounts that are vehicles, such as wagons and boats, the available skills are fixed, and can only be used when your character has reached a certain training or sailing life skill level.

For both vehicles and animals, you may need to equip a certain piece of gear to be able to use certain skills. There are different types of skills. For example, there are movement-focused skills, such as ‘Sprint’ or ‘Drift’, and attack skills, such as ‘Hind Kick’ or ‘Fore Chop’.
Since mounts are not specialized in combat by default, they are vulnerable to enemy attacks.Due to this, it’s useful to increase their defense by putting on equipment on them. Unlike equipment for Adventurers, equipment for mounts has special default features. For example, stirrups for horses and camels allow for mounted combat, while saddles allow the mount to run faster. Basic equipment for most types of mounts can be purchased from stable keepers and wharf managers, but better equipment can only be obtained by crafting it in a workshop.

Green grade equipment for horses, camels, donkeys, and miniature elephants can be crafted in many horse gear workshops around the world. Many types of them, such as light horse gear, combat horse gear, storm horse gear, and fighting spirit horse gear can also be obtained by exchanging horse race seals.

Blue grade equipment such as Granverre for horses, donkeys, and camels, and Muzika for miniature elephants can be crafted in Duvencrune and Stonetail Horse Ranch.

Yellow grade equipment, Krogdalo’s, for horses and donkeys can be crafted in Stonetail Horse Ranch.
One of the good things about mounts in Black Desert is that they have their own inventory.As mentioned previously, certain mounts such as wagons and boats can carry more weight than what a character can carry, so they’re useful when doing many of the life skill activities.

If you require additional inventory slots to store items in, you can use a mount’s inventory slots for this as well. Though keep in mind that a mount’s movement speed will decrease when weight is put on them.
If you wish to reset a mount’s statistics and skills it has obtained, you can use a reset mount growth item to do so.

If you have the reset mount growth item, open the Reset Mount menu to use it. It will reset the mount’s level to Lv. 1, all of its stats (Speed/Accel./Turn/Brake), and all the skills it had learned until then.

➤ You can read more about this topic in the [Reset Mount Growth] page.

Pets are some of Adventurers‘ most loyal, and cute, companions on their long journeys throughout Black Desert’s world.Their main reason for being is the auto-loot feature. Having fed pets allows Adventurers to cut through hordes of monsters without having to stop to pick up the dropped loot of every single defeated enemy. Instead, it is the pets that do this for them.

Check out how to get them, what roles they have, and what they can do, on this page.


While you can acquire a few pets as rewards from the main questline, some are given as login rewards, and even more can be obtained during temporary in-game and out of game events, they are mainly purchased from the Pearl Shop (hotkey: F3) with pearls.

The quests to obtain pets can be found in the Suggested tab of the Quest window (hotkey: O), in the section [ADV Support] Pets, Loyal Companions. These quests can only be completed once per family.



The pets acquired like this are the following ones:


• Bartali's BusterOnce you’ve completed any iteration of the main questline for Balenos, the first territory you explore in the world of Black Desert, or as you progress through the main questline for Mountain of Eternal Winter, you can accept the quest [Pet] Bartali's Buster from Igor Bartali, the Chief of Velia, or Bayan in the Mountain of Eternal Winter territory.
Bartali’s Buster comes with the talent +X% Skill Exp.

Lauren’s Fluffy comes with the talent +X% Death Penalty Reduction.
• Kalis' DelpheOnce you’ve completed any iteration of the main questline for Calpheon, or progressed through the main questline for Mountain of Eternal Winter, you can accept the quest [Pet] Kalis' Delphe from Herman Feresio, Chairman of the Kalis, in Calpheon City, or from Puteaux in the Mountain of Eternal Winter territory.
Kalis’ Delphe has the +X% Normal and +X% Higher Grade Knowledge Gain Chance talent.
• Bareeds' Junaid Once you’ve completed any iteration of the main questline for Mediah, you can accept the quest [Pet] Bareeds' Junaid from the Prince of Mediah, Prince Bareeds III.

Marumin’s Squawky comes with the +X% Normal and +X% Higher Grade Knowledge Gain Chance talent.



The pets you’ve received, either as a quest or event reward, or from the Pearl Shop, can be found as pet emblems in your character’s inventory (hotkey: I), either in the Inventory or Pearl tabs.

Once a pet has been obtained, it must be registered. To register a pet, right-click on the pet emblem item, and when prompted, give the pet a name.

What name will you give your new, cute friend~?

The moment you finish registering a pet, the Pet List will open automatically. In other situations, you can find it in the Function tab of the main menu (hotkey: Esc).



You can also access it from the paw button below your health bar, which will only appear after you’ve obtained your first pet.





From your pet list you can view all the pets that you currently possess, their information, and management options.

A pet can be summoned separately or as a group, with up to five pets summoned at any one time. To summon a pet, press the Take Out button to the right of the selected pet.



To summon pets as a group, assign a pet a flagged number by clicking on the appropriate icon beside their portrait.  To summon the grouped pets, click the associated icon at the bottom of the pet menu. You can see both the individual number icons for checked-in pets and the option to take out a group with the same number in the two images above.



If your pet isn’t picking up items, it means they’re hungry!Pets start with a hunger level at 100%. Once a pet is summoned, their hunger level will start to decrease.  If a pet’s hunger level reaches 0%, it will no longer retrieve loot while summoned.

Pets can be given feed to raise their hunger level. Feed can be bought mainly from any Stable Keeper NPC and from other Adventurers in the Central Market, and can be crafted through cooking.



When feeding a specific pet, or all of them at the same time, you can select the type of feed you want them to eat. Different types of feed, depending on their quality, will fill the hunger level at varying amounts.



The maximum tier a pet can reach is 5. At higher tiers, a pet can pick up loot at a faster rate, hold more talents, and their talent buffs increase.

A tier 1 pet will have 2 talents.A tier 4 pet has 4 talents. The same is true for a tier 5 pet.

➤ For details regarding tier 5 pets and how to obtain them, please check the [Tier 5 Pet Training / Alpha Appointment] page.



Pet commands can be toggled and will affect the way a pet behaves.




• Behavior
A pet’s behavior can be set to Cautious (slowest), Normal (default), or Agile (fastest); the more active their behavior mode is, the quicker they will pick up items, but at the same time, the faster their hunger level will decrease.

Make sure to take care of your pets’ hunger level at all times, as they will not pick up items nor will their talents take effect if their hunger level reaches 0.

Right-click the behavior command icon to change the behavior of all your pets at the same time.

• Follow / StayPets will continuously follow their owner until commanded to stay still. However, if the distance between the Adventurer and the pet is too great, the pet will reappear nearby.

• SpecialThis will toggle the pet’s special ability.

• FetchThis icon will toggle the pet auto-loot function.

In the example image above, the pet is set to be agile, to follow the Adventurer, and to have its special ability (auto-fishing time reduction) and the auto-loot function active.


Each pet has its own special ability. These are not enabled when pets are first summoned, and can be enabled through left-click and right-click. Left-click will enable only the selected pet’s special ability and right-click will enable them for all the summoned pets. There are the following special abilities:


• Hostility DetectionMarks Adventurers from hostile guilds and those who have negative karma.

• Finds ResourcesMoves to and marks a gatherable resource every few seconds.

• Finds Rare MonstersMoves to and marks rare (elite) monsters.

• Taunt MonsterDraws a monster to you.

• Resistant to Desert IllnessesProvides heatstroke and hypothermia resistance.

• Auto-Fishing Time ReductionProvides a reduction to the auto-fishing timer.

• Gathering Item Quantity IncreaseIncreases the quantity of items obtained via the gathering and hunting life skills.

For special abilities such as Hostility Detection and Finds Rare Monsters, it will leave a red marker on your screen when a target is found. If you do not want it to be displayed on your screen, click the pet command for special abilities to disable it and it will no longer be displayed.
Refer to the table below for which special abilities can stack and which cannot. For those that cannot, it means that only the effect of a single pet out with that special ability will be applied. If you have 4 pets summoned, all with the Auto-Fishing Time Reduction special ability, only the ability of 1 of them will be applied.




Pets can learn talent skills separate from their special ability. These are mainly divided into inherent talents and main skills. Talents are inherent to the pet, and are already there when you first obtain it. Main skills can be obtained when the pet’s tier is improved. The different types of each can be seen below.


The number of learnable talents increases based on the pet’s tier, so the higher the tier, the more of these skills that can be learned.



Are you having trouble managing your pets?If so, you can set up pet groups according to what you need and use them for. After this you can use the Call Group feature to use your pets in a more convenient way.
Additionally, above the Feed All button you will find the Rename Group button. This feature will help differentiate the distinct groups of pets you have more easily.





The pet exchange option is the way Adventurers can improve the tier of their pets. The higher the pet’s tier, the faster it will pick up loot, the higher the amount of talents it can learn, and the better they will be.


In this manner, what you’re doing is exchanging various pets at once for a better one. The more pets are exchanged at once, the higher odds of having a better resulting pet.Up to 5 pets can be exchanged for 1 pet at a time.

During the pet exchange, you can change the registered pet’s appearance and select the talents to be inherited from the exchange window. At this moment, if you acquire a pet tier that can learn more talents than the number of talents being inherited, then the pet will be able to learn additional ones.

However, please remember that pets are categorized into 5 types, and only pets of the same type can be exchanged together.


Then, shall we learn how to exchange pets?

First, press the Exchange button from the Pet List menu and the Exchange Pet window will appear.



Among the currently checked-in pets, you press the Exchange button (yellow & orange pet symbol with arrows, seen above) to select the pet you want to exchange, or to cancel the selection.

Once you’ve selected at least 2 pets you want to exchange, you can select the desired appearance and talent skills to be inherited from your registered pets before exchanging them.

The tier increase chance goes up depending on the number of selected pets and their tiers when exchanging them. As seen above, exchanging 2 tier 1 pets has a 55% chance of obtaining a tier 3 pet, and a 45% chance of obtaining a tier 2 pet.



Adding another tier 1 pet to the mix increases the chance to get a tier 3 to be absolute.The higher the initial tier of the pets to exchange, the more pets will be required to have better odds of increasing the resulting pet’s tier.



As seen above, to reach a 100% chance of obtaining a tier 4 pet, in this case 4 tier 3 pets of the same type (rare) are required.

Regarding the pet’s appearance, it is important to remember that the resulting pet will inherit the talent of the pet’s appearance you’ve chosen.

The appearance is not linked to its tier. For instance, when exchanging a tier 3 pet and a tier 1 pet, if you select the tier 1 pet’s appearance, then regardless of the obtained pet’s tier, its appearance will be the same as the tier 1 pet.



The Skill button will let you choose between a variety of obtainable skills.



The Skill Learning Chance button will show you the chance of the resulting pet obtaining each different talent.



Make sure to personalize the resulting pet as much as possible to obtain the desired outcome.Do not forget to name it, either!





Some pets’ appearance may be changed through the Pet Exchange function explained above, or with a Pet Appearance Change Coupon item. This will alter the coloring of the pet, give the pet  a unique pet costume, or change its look entirely. Not all pets have the ability to change appearances.



The coupon guarantees a selected appearance, but the pet’s appearance may not differ when trying this through a pet exchange.  Checking the ‘Appearance’ button below the pet that is being exchanged allows it to keep its current appearance.



Certain pets have the Gathering Item Quantity Increase special ability.




This special ability increases the quantity of items obtained via both the gathering and hunting life skills.

Subtópico: Swimming & Diving
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
The underwater world of Black Desert is completely different from the surface mainland where you can easily run around and employ mounts such as horses. You might have to swim at a low speed, or dive into the depths to find hidden treasures.

Big and small rivers and lakes are everywhere in the world, and one thing that Adventurers exploring the endless ocean must know is how to skillfully move underwater.




◈ Swimming
How do you move if your ship is destroyed on the vast open sea?
If you use the Escape function found in the main menu (hotkey: Esc), you can move to the nearest safe point, but there is a long cooldown period to wait for using it again, and you cannot move to your preferred destination at will. In these situations, the only answer is to swim.

Movement speed on water is quite different from running on land. The character’s swimming speed is fundamentally affected by its overall movement speed. If you are preparing for long-distance swimming, we recommend increasing your movement speed. For example, you can transfuse a magical crystal that increases movement speed on Talis equipment pieces, which have movement speed increase set effects. If you reach level 5 of movement speed by doing this, it will be greatly beneficial for whenever you’re out at sea.



Remember that stamina is constantly consumed by swimming.When stamina is exhausted, swimming speed slows down a lot, so if you come across an island or somewhere you can rest while swimming, it is good to recover stamina out of the water.

If there isn’t a place to rest outside of water, stop moving for a moment and press the key Q. This will permit you to recover stamina, albeit slowly, while above water.





As seen above, if you stop moving for a moment and press the F key while swimming, you will be able to recover stamina slowly on the spot.

However, remember that you cannot change equipment while swimming. If you experience an unexpected accident such as falling off a liner, or the ship you were on got destroyed while on the move, you might not have the time to change into movement speed enhanced equipment, and might have to swim through the ocean at a slow speed. To avoid this, the game offers a rescue option outside of the Escape function from the main menu: the Old Moon Flare.

If you find yourself in a situation like the one described, please open the main menu (hotkey: Esc) and open the Pearl Shop, which you can also access via the key F3. Go to the Loyalties tab, and scroll down until you find the Old Moon Flare. Once found, purchase one with loyalties.Using this item will call a rescue ship that will transport you to either Oquilla’s Eye or Lema Island.




◈ Diving
If you dive underwater you will find another world full of adventures.

You can dive into the water by pressing the key Q and use the directional (WASD) keys.Once underwater, you can rise to the surface with the directional keys or by keeping pressed the key E.

There is an important difference between swimming above water and diving underwater.If you swim above water, only your stamina gauge decreases, and your movement speed is decreased. If you dive underwater, a blue gauge appears on the screen. This is the breath gauge that shows you how long you can be diving underwater.

When the breath gauge is exhausted, the character will stop moving, will squirm, and come above water automatically. It is important to constantly check the breath gauge when exploring underwater, lest you get stuck in an underwater cave and have trouble rising to the surface.

The breath gauge can’t be recovered underwater, but there are certain locations in the seafloor all across the waters near the continents that have air bubbles which will allow you to refill your breath gauge.

When you go above water, the breath gauge instantly recovers and lets you dive again.



As seen in the example above, when the breath gauge is exhausted the character will become unresponsive and rise to the water surface automatically.

Since there is a limit to how much time you can explore underwater due to the breath gauge, if you roam around aimlessly you will just repeat sinking and floating time and time again.

It is necessary to check the area that you want to explore by diving into a certain depth, and then moving to the point selected from above water. This way you will only need to dive the shortest distance possible between your location and your objective.

Additionally, there are various equipment items and consumables that can be employed to increase your underwater breathing time, such as elixirs and magic crystals.



Transfuse the magic crystal into an equipment piece, and drink the elixir, and you’ll be able to spend more time diving underwater.
* The content of the game guide may differ from the actual game content, depending on the update and content changes.

Subtópico: Equipment
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
Almost all equipment (also known as gear) in Black Desert can be used freely regardless of the character's class. The exceptions are the different types of weapons, which are different for each class.
It is possible for a Lv. 1 Berserker to be equipped with powerful equipment with which a high level Sorceress was equipped. That is because most of the items in Black Desert are free to buy and sell, except for some character-bound items acquired as a reward for a quest, or those rented with contribution points.
Equipment is very important for the survival of your characters, their stamina, and their speed in battle.



◈ Weapons
These consist of your character’s main weapon, sub-weapon (also called the off-hand weapon),  and awakening weapon. The type of weapon of each category you can equip differs depending on the character’s class.

Main weapons and sub-weapons can be obtained and used from Lv. 1. However, keep in mind that certain classes can use more than one type of each. Some, like Ninja and Kunoichi, have different skills available to them depending on the sub-weapon they’re using (kunai or shuriken).

Differently named weapons have different special effects as well as different inherent stats, so you need to be careful when choosing them.

The third weapon, the awakening weapon, can be used after completing the Awakening quests available for most classes from Lv. 56. Exceptions exist, like the class Archer being able to use it from Lv. 1, albeit not fully fledged.



Please note that if you have not completed the Awakening questline, even if you have obtained an awakening weapon you won’t be able to equip it.After completing these quests and equipping an awakening weapon you can learn the different Awakening skills and fight in a more often than not completely different way than before.

Conversely, if you choose  the Succession state instead of Awakening, you will still be equipping an awakening weapon, and its stats will be partially reflected in your attack power, but you will not be able to carry out awakening skills. Instead, you can acquire Succession skills, which make your existing skills more powerful.



In Black Desert, defense gear refers to a total of four pieces of equipment: armor, helmet, shoes, and gloves. These mainly increase your total defense. The higher this one is, the less damage your character will take, and greater its evasion chance will be.

Some defense gear pieces, often those considered to be boss gear, and other sets such as the Blackstar one, can receive set effects if several of their pieces are worn together. For example, three pieces of boss equipment worn at the same time will grant your character  +200 max stamina, and if among them you have two pieces of Blackstar equipment, the character will receive an additional +10 reduction to monster damage.

Defense gear can be used everywhere, without any restriction placed by character level or character class.

Additionally, while most types of defense gear are meant to help in battle, there are also equipment pieces of this type that raise stats related to life skills.



◈ Accessories
Accessories are divided into rings, earrings, necklaces and belts. You can wear two rings and earrings each, and only one necklace and belt.

While weapons focus on increasing your offensive capabilities, and defense gear your defensive ones, accessories are versatile. There are both offensive and defensive accessories, as well as those useful for life skills.



◈ Artifacts
Artifacts, relics imbued with the power of the witches of Everfrost, have certain bonuses on their own, but it's important to wear them after they’ve been infused with lightstones. This way, additional benefits can be obtained.

You can equip 2 lightstones per artifact, and depending on the combination of lightstones you use, you can get various additional stats as set effects.

➤ For more information on this topic, please check the [Artifacts & Lightstones] and [Lightstone Combinations] pages.



◈ Alchemy Stones
Items equipped to the alchemy stone slot bring special effects for a certain period of time by pressing the U key.

Depending on the type of stone, it usually has a name like Polished Alchemy Stone of Destruction, or Life Spirit Stone, but there are also those with unique names such as Vell's Heart and Kutum's Power Stone.



As seen in the picture above, alchemy stones may offer you offensive, defensive, life skill-related, or even unique effects for a short period of time, usually from 5 to 10 minutes.

Most spirit stones and alchemy stones produced via alchemy can be sold to other Adventurers in the Central Market. Others, like Kutum’s Power Stone, cannot be sold, and once depleted cannot be used again. The trait of being one-time use stones is shared among spirit stones, including even those that can be sold.

➤ You can read more about this type of equipment in the [Alchemy Stone] page.



◈ Adventurer’s Tome
The basic adventurer's tome is provided at the beginning of a character’s adventure by the Black Spirit, but you can also obtain new, different tomes through specific quests.

Among them, the Chenga - Sherekhan Tome of Wisdom has the effect of increasing the amount of combat experience obtained as a quest reward by 30% when equipped, enabling the so-called 'Chengarun,' which allows you to quickly complete quests and level up with an optimized route.






Durability decreases as items are used, for example, as an armor absorbs damage, its durability decreases. Additionally, the visual appearance of your equipped items will be affected by the durability loss, which leads to showing your character with degraded clothes.

So long as an equipment item has at least 1 durability, the beneficial effects will persist while equipped. If the durability is reduced to 0, it will be the same as not having the item equipped.

So, before the durability drops to 0, you can get your items repaired by a blacksmith, or you can recover the durability through an anvil in one of your residences.

When repairing a weapon of a reduced maximum durability, depending on the amount of repair carried out, the maximum durability may increase by a small chance.

If repairs are making you annoyed, you can use equipment that doesn’t have durability.The equipment pieces that can be rented from an NPCs using contribution points are not subject to durability.

For such equipment, the better the status, the more contribution points are required. When you no longer need that piece, or want to use the contribution points for something else, you can take back your contribution points when you return the item rented.However, the bad news is that the rented equipment is not available for enhancement, and is heavier than general equipment.

➤ Please check the [Repair] page for more information on equipment durability.

In the case of alchemy stones, durability is consumed every time you use it, and for most alchemy stones it can be restored by recharging the alchemy stone with fuel materials.This feature can be accessed from the Stone button of the Inventory window (hotkey: I).



However, please remember that as mentioned previously, certain items equipped to the alchemy stone slot, such as spirit stones and Kutum’s Power Stone, cannot be recharged.



Life skill clothes made for the convenience of life skill activities show high efficiency during these activities.

In the case of a professional gatherer’s uniform, you can collect resources without being attacked first by nearby monsters for as long as you’re crouching or gathering.Additionally, if the enhancement level of a piece of equipment of this type improves, it will increase the benefits it bestows upon being equipped. In the case of silver embroidered gatherer’s clothes, its gathering ability will be upgraded, allowing you to gather faster.

You can summon the Black Spirit to improve equipment via both the enhancement and item reform options, making the items obtain better stats and effects.

If you reform an item, depending on the type of item it is and the reform item you employed, an extra modifier will be added to it. Depending on the modifier, different unique effects are given to the item.

In the case of weapons, if the modifier ‘Fiery’ is given, unique effects will be given depending on the type of equipment it is.



In the case of reforming equipment pieces with an inverted heart of Garmoth, as seen above sub-weapons will be given +150 max HP, +100 max stamina, and +10% special attack evasion rate, while awakening weapons will be given +2 crystal slots and +3% critical hit damage.

➤ Please check the [Enhancement] page for more information about this feature.

Regarding special effects obtained from sets, different sets offer different special effects.Generally, there are 3 to 4 parts, such as a helmet, armor, gloves, and shoes, for a set.





The gathering life skill requires the use of gathering tools, including lumbering axes, fluid collectors, hoes, butcher knives, tanning knives, pickaxes, and more.

To use these tools, you can directly equip them in the gathering tool slot, or put them in the Liana's tool bag, a bag dedicated to gathering tools, and then equip this one.

Afterwards, if you go near an object that can be collected, the interaction window will be activated, and if you are holding the proper gathering tool, you can collect from it right away.

Additionally, the more you gather, the higher your gathering life skill level will be.The higher you go, the better gathering tools you can wear, reducing the time it takes to gather.

Conteúdo do Subtópico:
As you fight your way through the world of Black Desert, your equipment will begin to lose durability, causing it to eventually reach an unusable state.To prevent your equipment from breaking, you can visit a blacksmith or other NPC with the repair functionality, found in most towns, or you can repair it yourself in a residence of your own with a personal anvil.

➤ For information on the different types of equipment, please visit the [Equipment] page.



After accessing the Repair menu, press the Repair button. This will open a confirmation window detailing the location of all the pieces of equipment that can be currently repaired, and the silver it will cost to repair it all.

Those items in your inventory that can be repaired will be highlighted. You can right click each to repair them individually. The same applies for items currently equipped. You can right click each of them to repair them individually. This is for cases in which you don’t have much silver and want to specify which item you want to repair.
When enhancing items with black stones, upon failure the maximum durability of the item is decreased. This means that over time the gear you are trying to improve will become less and less overall durable unless you sacrifice similar items to restore it. The less maximum durability an item has, the faster it will become unusable when its durability is decreased from using it.

For example, to repair the maximum durability of an Agerian helmet, you must use another Agerian helmet for the repair. If you want to repair a variant of an equipment piece, such as an Agerian helmet of agility, you can either use a base Agerian helmet along with a specific amount of silver, or one Agerian helmet of the same or different variant. The item you choose to sacrifice for the repairs will be destroyed.
Shown above, different states of the durability of items.


For expensive pieces of equipment, like those in which cases purchasing a new base item for the repair is too costly or difficult, it is recommended to use memory fragments instead. They serve the same purpose as identical equipment pieces for repair. Depending on the grade of the equipment piece you want to restore the maximum durability of, memory fragments may be less effective, requiring more of them.



You also have a small chance to restore one maximum lost durability each time an NPC repairs your items.

➤ For information on the improvement of equipment, please visit the [Enhancement] page.



Subtópico: Enhancement
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
The black stone not only takes a big part in Black Desert’s story, but it’s also an important part of the game. That is because it serves a role as the basic ingredient necessary to improve, enhance, the properties of equipment.

Have you ever wanted to wear better equipment and easily defeat monsters? Any Adventurer in Black Desert’s world can do this through enhancement.



You can access the Enhancement interface by talking with your Black Spirit (hotkey: , ).


While traveling throughout the world of Black Desert, you’re bound to listen to certain words over and over again: PRI, DUO, TRI, TET, and PEN. But, what do they mean? They’re related to the level of enhancement a piece of equipment (gear) has.

Weapons and armor in Black Desert can be (mostly) enhanced a total of 20 levels.From base to +15, the piece shows its enhancement level with a number.From Lv. 16 to Lv. 20 of enhancement, the levels are indicated as PRI (I), DUO (II), TRI (III), TET (IV), and PEN (V).

Rings, necklaces, belts, and earrings, which are accessories, can be enhanced a total of 5 levels. These are marked as PRI (I), DUO (II), TRI (III), TET (IV), and PEN (V), respectively.


Equipment enhancement in Black Desert is carried out via the consumption of enhancement materials by the Black Spirit so it can improve your equipment pieces.

The enhancement material employed depends on the type of equipment to be improved (weapons, defense gear, accessories), and the enhancement level.

Please refer to the table below.


Most equipment enhancement can be carried out following the above rules, but keep in mind that some equipment will require other materials.

Below are some of the exceptional cases in which different enhancement materials are needed.(Do not worry, you do not have to memorize them. You’ll naturally find them as you progress through the game.)





Enhancement is the action to improve the stats (AP or DP) of equipment.Most equipment pieces can be safely enhanced up to +7 for weapons, and +5 for armor without failure. It is the so-called 'safe enhancement' range, and thereafter you will be able to increase the enhancement level by small chances. If you fail enhancement, the maximum durability of the equipment might decrease, the enhancement level may be lowered, or the piece might be destroyed, depending on the type of item.Especially for accessories, such as necklace, earrings, belt, and rings, if you fail enhancement, note that both the item you wanted to enhance and the ingredient item used for enhancement can disappear.

Please also note that the higher the level of enhancement you are attempting, the greater the maximum durability decrease will be.



With that said, once you have the equipment piece you want to improve, and its correct ingredient for enhancement, summon the Black Spirit (hotkey: , ), and select the Enhancement option.



The marked areas of the picture above are explained below.

1. Enhancement MaterialsIf there are suitable enhancement materials in your character’s inventory, they will be selected automatically when selecting the equipment to be enhanced.

2. Enhancement Success ProbabilityThe success rate of the current enhancement. It is determined by the type of equipment to be enhanced, the level of enhancement, and the increased rate of equipment enhancement.

3. Equipment to Be EnhancedThis is the equipment piece you have selected to be enhanced.

4. Max Durability Decreased on FailureIf equipment enhancement fails, the maximum durability is reduced by the value written here.If the maximum durability is lowered to a certain level, you can no longer continue to try to enhance the piece. In that case, you have to restore the item’s maximum durability.

As seen in the picture above, for certain pieces of equipment, such as accessories, instead of telling you the item may lose maximum durability upon failure the game will warn you the item will be destroyed upon failure.

5. Equipment Enhancement Rate IncreaseIt is a number that affects the probability of success of enhancement. It is also commonly called a 'stack' among Adventurers.If an enhancement fails, it accumulates and increases, and if it succeeds, it is consumed.In numbers, if you fail an enhancement attempt, the enhancement chance increases by 1. As the count increases, the success chance for the next enhancement gets higher.

By using this, one can repeatedly fail to enhance equipment with low enhancement probability to build up so-called ‘failstacks.’After building the enhancement chance to a satisfactory level, it is then time to try to enhance the equipment piece you want improved.

Please note that Loggia, Geranoa, and Manos clothes and accessories that can increase life skill-related stats are not affected by the 'Equipment Enhancement Probability Increase' value, and instead have a fixed probability according to the enhancement level.

6. EnhanceFinally, when you press this button, the enhancement attempt is made. The result is irreversible, so please click carefully!



Above the safe enhancement range (weapon +7, defense gear +5), the force-enhancement function will be activated to proceed with enhancement with a 100% chance of success. However, for force-enhancement, you need more black stones than the amount you need for general enhancement. The higher the level of enhancement, the more black stones will be required, and as this process is forceful, the maximum durability of the item will decrease.It is also important to note that, depending on the level of enhancement, the decrease in the maximum durability of the item will be severe. If the maximum durability of an item becomes 20 or less due to enhancement failure or force-enhancement, it will no longer be available for enhancement. If the maximum durability becomes 0, you can no longer use that equipment piece until its maximum durability has been restored.



The black stones that have been used for enhancement can be recovered in proportion to the enhancement level through the Black Stone Extraction option at a blacksmith.However, the equipment from which the black stones are extracted will be destroyed permanently. If you have increased the enhancement level of an item through safe enhancement only, you can recover as many black stones as the number of black stones you have used for enhancement.If you have increased the enhancement level above safe enhancement, the number of black stones you will recover is the level plus a certain number within a range.

➤ Please check the [Extraction] page for more information on this topic.



To avoid this happening, you use cron stones. With the use of these stones you can prevent weapons and defense gear from losing enhancement levels, and for accessories, you may be able to prevent them from being destroyed.Please note that in the case of accessories, they may not be destroyed, however, their enhancement level might decrease by a certain chance.



You can obtain cron stones by purchasing them from a Blacksmith NPC in towns, by extracting them from pearl outfits, as in small but steady amounts via boss encounters and as event rewards.



If you check the 'Use Cron Stone' option in the Enhancement window, you can safely proceed with enhancement.

The number of cron stones required is displayed in the cron stone slot at the top left, and varies depending on the equipment to be enhanced and the level of enhancement.
As said above, when enhancing with cron stones, weapons and defense gear do not decrease in enhancement level upon failure, and in the case of accessories, instead of being destroyed, the enhancement level may drop.

Additionally, it is important to know that if you enhance with cron stones the equipment enhancement chance will not increase in case of failure, and that all necessary cron stones will be consumed even if you succeed in the enhancement attempt.

Therefore, when deciding to enhance using cron stones, carefully consider various factors such as: The number of cron stones required, if it is worth using them with that piece of equipment (if it would be cheaper to instead re-enhance the piece, silver-wise), your current probability of success, and so on.



In order to restore the lowered maximum durability of an equipment piece, equipment of the same type as the target (base, at +0) or memory fragments are required.Therefore, it is important to know when it is better to use one or the other, depending on the cost of repair of the item.

➤ Please check the [Repair] page for more information on equipment durability and how to repair it.




What if you want to keep the increased enhancement chance you’ve obtained and use it later?To extract the enhancement chance in item form you can use a blacksmith’s secret book to create ‘advice of Valks.’


Blacksmith’s secret books can be purchased from Blacksmith NPCs in major towns.

When you purchase a blacksmith’s secret book, please keep in mind that you need to purchase the proper secret book that is applicable to the enhancement chance you want to extract.

For blacksmith’s secret books, the extraction of an enhancement chance that is less than what is written in the secret book is allowed.For example, if the current enhancement chance you want to extract is +21, blacksmith’s secret book - 20 cannot be used for extraction. Blacksmith’s secret book - 30 would be the proper item.

Once you’ve purchased the proper secret book, summon the Black Spirit and access the enhancement menu.



If you have a blacksmith’s secret book, the Extract Chance button becomes active.



Right-click the secret book you have in your inventory, then press the Extract button to proceed with extraction. Agree with the warning window, and the enhancement chance you had will be extracted as an advice of Valks item of the same amount. However, keep in mind that any ‘Valks’ cry’ chance increase you may have had applied will not be extracted.If you proceed with the enhancement chance extraction while you had Valks’ cry applied, the enhancement chance will be reset to 0 but the amount of Valks’ cry applied will remain the same.



Using Naderr’s band is another method to preserve the enhancement chance you’ve obtained to enhance equipment.



These are slots that can store equipment enhancement chances.Unlike a blacksmith's secret book, these have the advantage that they can be preserved without being limited to the number a book dictates, and in addition to that, the probability increase value from Valks' cry is also saved.

However, there is a limit on the maximum number of slots that can be used.A 5-second cooldown is given after using Naderr's band to transfer an enhancement chance of 100 or higher.

This functionality can be unlocked after completing the short Naderr’s band questline in the village of Tarif, in Mediah. It can only be accepted once per family, when you are level 58 or higher.If you fulfill the quest requirements, receive the [Naderr's Band] Magic of the Dark Energy quest from the Black Spirit and progress through them.By using the quest reward Nader's parchment, you can activate both the functionality and unlock one slot.

One other Naderr's band slot can also be obtained via the Pearl Shop with loyalties.



Valks' cry is an item that increases the success rate of equipment enhancement.



Apart from the increase in equipment enhancement success probability obtained by failing to enhance equipment, each time you use Valks' cry, you can get +1 chance increase.

By default, up to 10 Valks’ cry can be used together for one enhancement.You can use up to 13 in total if you complete the entirety of the Sherald's Journal in your Adventure Log.

It can be obtained as a quest reward, from events, and via the Pearl Shop.



Through devouring, your Black Spirit can consume items of a high enhancement level and others to convert them into an increase in the success rate of equipment enhancement.The act of devouring gear can add an additional value even if you currently have an equipment enhancement chance of 1 or higher.

There is a chance of failure, and regardless of success, the equipment selected to be devoured will disappear, so choose carefully.

Please note that certain equipment, such as Blackstar and Godr-Ayed, cannot be devoured.




◈ Another Adventurer's Choice
Have you ever wondered how many stacks are needed to enhance TRI (III) Tuvala gear? When you have selected an equipment piece to enhance it, by pressing the icon that appears to the right of Current Enhancement Chance, you can see the enhancement chances used by other Adventurers for the same type of item on that enhancement level.



The information from the Another Adventurer's Choice window will refresh when the window is opened, and that gear without enough data on enhancement chances will be displayed only once there is enough data to be assessed.

Please note that the following equipment will not display information on other Adventurers' choice of enhancement chance: Accessories for guaranteed PEN (V) accessory enhancement, equipment for guaranteed PEN (V) boss gear enhancement, and Naru equipment.


◈ Group Enhancement
Adventurers with the same enhancement level (for example, both attempting to enhance from level IV to V) can enhance together. As shown in the screenshot below, once all party members are ready, the party leader initiates the enhancement attempt and everyone enhances together.



However, keep in mind that there is no increase in enhancement success rate or any additional benefit from enhancing in a group. Likewise, when using the Group Enhancement feature, the use of Cron stones works as before, not affected by the feature. This is simply a small feature designed for Adventurers who may have been hesitant to enhance alone or for those who want to enhance with like-minded guild members or friends.

Note the following restrictions when using this feature:





You can use the Caphras enhancement feature to improve TRI (III) or higher enhancement level weapons and defense gear. For this procedure, you will need Caphras stones. These can be obtained by synthetizing black stones with ancient spirit dust. This one in turn can be obtained from quests, and by defeating monsters and gathering.

You can access this feature in the same Enhancement window, by pressing the Caphras option.



Caphras enhancement has a total of 20 levels.The TRI (III) or higher weapon and defense gear will get EXP when you infuse them with Caphras stones.
They go up a level once they get enough EXP. They get a new effect each time they level up. These tend to be an increase in their inherent stats, such as accuracy, AP, DP, evasion, damage reduction, and more.

When a piece of equipment reaches Caphras enhancement Lv. 20, it can be safely improved to the next enhancement level (e.g. III → IV, IV → V).

The item needs to have 100 max durability to upgrade it. Once it’s successfully upgraded, it will have 0 max durability and its Caphras enhancement levels will be reset.

Be careful when you try to attempt a regular enhancement with an item that has Caphras enhancement levels or any Caphras stone infused in it at all. If you fail the enhancement, only 50% of the Caphras enhancement EXP (and thus Caphras stones) will be transferred over.
If you succeed with a regular enhancement, then 10% of the Caphras enhancement EXP will be transferred over.

The table below shows the effects each type of item gets at every Caphras enhancement level.Please note that the effects do not accumulate.

Brief Summary of Caphras Enhancement
• Caphras enhancement consists of consuming Caphras stones to improve equipment stats.
• 95% of the consumed Caphras stones can be extracted through extraction, and 100,000 silver coins are consumed per stone.
• When enhancing equipment that has been improved with these stones, only 10% of the Caphras stones are preserved in case of success, and 50% in case of failure. It is recommended to preserve 95% through extraction before enhancing a piece.
• If the number of Caphras stones you have available is limited when using this feature with TRI (III) ~ TET (IV) pieces, it is more efficient to improve them only up to Caphras Lv. 4!
After summoning the Black Spirit (hotkey: , ), you can access it by selecting the Enhancement option, and then pressing the Caphras section.

Caphras enhancement has 20 levels. If you infuse a weapon or defense gear piece at TRI or higher with Caphras stones, it will earn EXP. Once enough EXP has been obtained, it will obtain a Caphras level.Upon increasing its Caphras level, the equipment piece receives improved stats. A weapon may have its AP and accuracy increased, while a defense gear may have its DP, damage reduction, evasion, HP, and more, improved.

Once you reach Caphras Lv. 20 on a piece of equipment, you will be able to force-enhance it to the next normal enhancement level, e.g. TRI (III) → TET (IV), TET (IV) → PEN (V). To do this, the piece needs to have 100 max durability, and upon force-enhancing it, its max durability will be decreased to 0.Additionally, all Caphras stones will be consumed.
Important
Remember that, if the enhancement level of an item decreases after failing an enhancement attempt, only 50% of the infused Caphras stones will be preserved.
Conversely, if you succeed in the enhancement, 10% of the previously infused Caphras stones will remain.
Therefore, if you want to lose as few Caphras stones as possible when enhancing equipment, make sure to extract them beforehand. This way, you can conserve as much as 95% of all Caphras stones.
➤ Please check the [Extraction] page for more information on how to extract Caphras stones.
This section is a reference sheet for the enhancement of equipment with Caphras stones. Here you will find tables showing the amount of Caphras stones required for each Caphras level of enhancement of each type of equipment allowed to be improved with this feature.

Caphras enhancement has 20 levels, but for practical purposes the tables shown below list the first 10 levels of enhancement, as these are the necessary ones to exchange your existing equipment for better one. For example, you can exchange a PEN: Dim Tree Spirit’s Armor with 10 levels of Caphras enhancement for a Fallen God’s Armor. For more information on this type of equipment and how to obtain it, please visit the [Slumbering Origin Gear] page.

In order to fight against the endless hordes of enemies in the world of Black Desert, the process of enhancing equipment, also known as gear, is very important.

This page provides information on gear, from the most basic Naru set, to the end-game Slumbering Origin gear (Fallen God's Armor and Labreska's Helmet), and even information on the best methods normally used by many Adventurers to enhance the quality of their gear.

You can obtain Naru gear for all equipment slots as quest rewards at the beginning of the main questline, as you journey through the territories of Balenos and Serendia.Especially if you’re a new Adventurer, it is an essential type of equipment that will be by your side until you reach Lv. 50.

It is recommended for Adventurers who’ve obtained Naru gear to equip it and gather beginner black stones, a material for their enhancement, to aim for a full set of PEN (V) enhanced Naru gear.

Enhancing Naru gear is very simple. Since the default enhancement success rate is very high, you can easily reach PEN (V) enhancement level by continuously pressing the Enhancement button with enough materials gathered, without the need for enhancement success rate increases, also known as enhancement “stacks.”Beginner black stones can be obtained via quest rewards as you progress in the main questline. Do not be discouraged for not receiving many of them initially. The number of beginner black stones rewarded from quests significantly ramps up by the time you’re traversing the territory of Mediah.

Alternatively, if you’re low on them even after completing the main questline for Mediah, you can use the heating option from the processing (hotkey: L) window with black stones (weapon/armor) to obtain each respective type of beginner black stones. However, keep in mind this should be considered a last resort, as normal black stones are valuable for many other purposes.

➤ You can read more about the enhancement feature in the [Enhancement] page.

Around the time you have enhanced your Naru equipment to PEN (V), you can either obtain the more powerful Narchillan gear (once per family, for normal characters), or exchange it for PRI (I) Tuvala gear (for a character in each season).


You can obtain Narchillan equipment once per family. The Narchillan gear pieces have stats comparable to TRI (III) to TET (IV) boss gear, or DUO (II) - TRI (III) Blackstar gear.

Equipping gear and accessories at the level of Narchillan gear and Capotia accessories will take you to the level at which you can defeat monsters in monster zones with a recommended AP of 240, such as Aakman Temple in Valencia or the Forest Ronaros of Tooth Fairy Forest in Kamasylvia.

However, remember that it’s normally recommended for season characters to exchange PEN (V) Naru gear for PRI (I) Tuvala gear. Check out the details regarding this in the section Tuvala (Season Character) below.
Important!
•  You cannot get these quests with a season character, but you can get them with a graduated season character!• You can only obtain Narchillan gear once per family.As long as you meet these requirements, you can obtain Narchillan gear from Fughar with ease.

If you can no longer equip the obtained Narchillan gear due to switching to and progressing another class, do not worry. You can change the Narchillan gear into a box that can then be opened by a different class via the following method:

1. Purchase Narchillan processing stones from a blacksmith located in each major city (1 million silver each).2. Use the manufacture processing option with Narchillan processing stone and a Narchillan weapon you want to convert into a box.3. Open the Narchillan weapon box with another class to obtain weapons suitable for that class.

You can check out the [How to Obtain Gear through Quests] page for more options regarding equipment one can obtain as they explore the world of Black Desert.

Tuvala gear is season-exclusive gear that can only be equipped by season characters.However, after season graduation is made available, you can use conversion stones on the gear to make them equippable by normal characters, and can even exchange them for TET (IV) boss gear (one piece per season).

You could say the main goal for season characters is graduating after getting all Tuvala gear pieces to PEN (V) enhancement level. However, keep in mind there may be other important objectives in any current season, and that graduating will make you unable to accomplish them if you graduate too early.

The following UI will be displayed when you have succeeded in enhancing your Naru gear up to PEN (V) enhancement level with a season character, and you can use it to exchange your Naru gear for PRI (I) Tuvala gear.

The following two options won’t compete with Tuvala and Narchillan equipment, but offer you alternative options in case you ever need them.

Cliff’s weapons are available only to new and returning Adventurers upon the completion of certain quests.

• Adventurers logging in within 60 days (1440 hours) of creating a character family are considered new Adventurers.
• Adventurers who haven’t logged in to the game for at least 30 days (720 hours), and haven’t used the Web Central Market (via the Black Desert+ app or the official website) for at least 30 days are considered returning Adventurers.

You can receive the quests to obtain Cliff’s weapons from Cliff himself at the Western Guard Camp, in Balenos, after completing the quest [New/Returning] Cliff's Weapon given by the Black Spirit. This one in turn requires you to have completed any iteration of the main questline for Calpheon, or to have completed the main questline for Mountain of Eternal Winter.

After this is done, Cliff will task you with a quest suited for your level, and let you choose a Cliff's Main / Sub-weapon / Awakening Weapon (+15) Box. You will need to complete the three quests available for your level to obtain the three weapons.



Once obtained, these weapons can be enhanced up to TET.If you no longer need them, you can exchange them with NPC Miguel Aries for gold bars.



As for the Roaring Magical Armor, you will obtain it as you progress through the final stretch of the main questline for Mediah. It is a reward for the quest [Boss] Illezra's Servant.



The Roaring Magical Armor is better than a PEN: Naru Armor, but worse than both a PRI: Tuvala Armor and a Narchillan Armor, and cannot be enhanced.


If you are an Adventurer with all PEN (V) Tuvala gear pieces, or the Narchillan equipment set, first get TET (IV) boss gear, then aim for enhancing them up to PEN (V).

➤ You can read more about these bosses, such as where and when to find them, in the [World Bosses] and [Field Bosses] pages.

Does it look like a very difficult goal to achieve PEN (V) enhancement level because of the pressure you feel from the title, “boss gear?” It isn’t that difficult if you go through the following process step by step.

First, if you’ve graduated from a season, you can obtain conversion stones for Tuvala gear, which you can use for each piece of gear.Tuvala gear conversion stones are items that convert season-exclusive Tuvala gear to allow you to continue using them even after season graduation. Use the Tuvala gear conversion stones on the PEN (V) Tuvala gear in your possession.   The next step is to exchange your PEN (V) Tuvala gear for TET (IV) boss gear, then upgrade these for guaranteed PEN (V) boss gear via quests given by NPC Jetina, found in all cities.

Boss equipment pieces obtained from the quests for guaranteed PEN (V) boss gear are family-bound and cannot be registered on the Central Market or be sold. However, for armor and helmets, they can be converted into Fallen God’s Armor and Labreska’s Helmet, which are top-tier gear, and will no longer be family-bound and will be able to be registered on the Central Market.   ➤ Please check out the [Guaranteed PEN (V) Boss Gear] page for a full explanation of this feature.

How should you enhance the yellow grade accessories that come after PEN (V) Tuvala accessories?First, we recommend all Adventurers to accept and complete the quests for a guaranteed PEN (V) accessory.

It is recommended that you take and progress through the quests for a guaranteed PEN (V) accessory as a long-term task. This is a quest from which you can obtain one PEN (V) Ring of Crescent Guardian, Narc Ear Accessory, or Tungrad Earring, once per family.

PEN (V) accessories are considered very rare, and extremely expensive, due to all the pieces used for enhancement being destroyed upon a failed enhancement and their low enhancement success rate. That said, ever since the quest for guaranteed PEN (V) accessories was implemented, everybody can now have at least one PEN (V) accessory.

However, as they are very valuable items that take a while to obtain, we recommend you to be a little more patient, and continue to make enhancement attempts in the meantime. Take note that the three types of accessories to choose from can also be exchanged during the quests, in case you change your mind regarding which one you want. It should also be noted that the most popular choice among Adventurers is the Ring of Crescent Guardian.

➤ Please check out the [Guaranteed PEN (V) Accessory] page for more details on how this process works.

As for obtaining normal yellow grade accessories, you can get them from defeating monsters in the different monster zones found throughout the world. To give an example, Ring of Crescent Guardian is obtained in Crescent Shrine, in the territory of Valencia, while Tungrad accessories can be obtained from different ancient ruins. You can check the [Monster Zone Info] window for more information on how to find where each yellow grade accessory can be obtained from.Alternatively, you can purchase them from the Central Market.

You can obtain one of the PEN (V) Capotia accessories as a gift for graduating from a season. They are items that perform as well as regular yellow grade TET (IV) accessories, and can be considered a tier higher than the PEN (V) Tuvala Ring.

You can obtain a special season gift by going to Fughar, with a Lv. 20 or higher season character, or a character that has completed the [Season Server Graduation] Into the Big Wide World quest for each season. Please note that you can only obtain one of these gifts per season, and only once per family.

Adventurers receiving the special gift for season graduation might not be sure which item to accept, but we strongly recommend selecting the PEN (V) Capotia Necklace first. The Capotia Necklace has the greatest AP increase compared to the offered earring, ring, or belt.

◈ Extra – Asula's Crimson Eye & Quest Accessories
As you work towards obtaining normal yellow grade, guaranteed PEN (V), and PEN (V) Capotia accessories, if your character isn’t experiencing season content, you might ask yourself what accessories you can equip in the meantime after you’ve obtained PEN (V) Naru.

While the following may not be the best type of gear available, they will be enough to help you complete the main questlines.
You can also exchange x3 Asula’s Weakened Magic accessories for an Asula’s Crimson Eye accessory.

Additionally, defeating a specific number of monsters in certain monster zones will reward you with DUO (II) - TRI (III) Asula's Crimson Eye accessories. There are 4 types of subjugation missions that will automatically proceed once you enter a specific monster zone with the appropriate level requirement. The monster zones with these subjugation missions are Abandoned Iron Mine, Helms Post, Wandering Rogue Den, and Elric Shrine.
– Main Questline

You can get a few unique accessories as a reward as you progress through the main questlines.There are 4 types - the Red Sand Crystal Ring, Forest’s Eye Earring, Rock Heart Belt, and the Tears of the Wind Necklace.You can get these by completing the main questlines of Valencia, Kamasylvia, Drieghan, and O’dyllita, respectively.

Not only are these accessories quite decent for new Adventurers, but you can also enhance them up to TRI (III). Should enhancement fail, the accessory will only lose durability rather than being completely destroyed.

Characters from the same family can equip these accessories without any limitations. They can also be helpful for strengthening newly created characters.

Complete the quests above once per character to be rewarded with an accessory. If you find a quest difficult to complete, you can always get the help of a friend or your fellow guild members.

You can enhance these accessories with normal black stones, and if your enhancement fails, the accessory will not be destroyed, but it will lose durability. However, you can restore their durability by using memory fragments at a much higher durability recovery rate per memory fragment employed than usual (50 durability recovered per memory fragment used).

TET (IV) Blackstar gear and PEN (V) boss gear are at a similar level, and PEN (V) Blackstar gear can be considered overall the highest-tier gear out of all the existing gear sets.

That being said, please note that Blackstar gear cannot be enhanced with Caphras stones. If enhancement with Caphras stones is taken into account, PEN (V) Blackstar gear has stats similar to PEN (V) boss gear enhanced to the highest possible level of Caphras enhancement.

You can purchase Blackstar equipment pieces from the Central Market, or craft them via certain questlines once per character.

➤ Please refer to the [Crafting Blackstar Gear] page for more details on crafting Blackstar equipment.

If you have come to the point where you have to either purchase or craft these items, you can consider yourself an Adventurer fully acclimated to Black Desert.
In order to craft them, you need very valuable items such as a PEN (V) boss defense gear piece enhanced to at least Caphras Lv. 10 (like a PEN (V) Giath’s Helmet or Red Nose’s Armor) or a PEN (V) Blackstar Armor or Helmet, a Flame of Despair or Flame of Frost, etc.

➤ Please refer to the [Crafting Slumbering Origin Gear] page for more details.

Subtópico: Outfits & Costumes
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
In Black Desert, alongside normal equipment, there are outfits and costumes that change the visual appearance of your characters and may grant you additional benefits.

When looking at your character’s equipment window (hotkey: I), you can see that the equipment slots (outer circle) and the appearance slots (inner circle) are separate.When you equip an outfit or a costume, and you also have a normal equipment piece equipped for the same body part slot, only the outfit or costume will be visible by default.


Both outfits and costumes can be equipped in your equipment’s appearance slots. While they may offer special effects, they’re mostly decorative and a great tool to visually distinguish your characters from those of other Adventurers.

An outfit is generally obtained in the Pearl Shop, though you may also receive them from events and gifts. All of them share individual item special effects that depend on the type of body slot they’re for, and a set effect. The more outfit pieces you wear, the greater the benefits of the set effect. You do not need to wear all pieces from the same outfit set to receive the set effects.Outfits can also be extracted at a blacksmith in a town. From the extraction, you can choose to obtain either Valks’ cry or Cron stones.Additionally, outfit armor pieces can be enhanced with a black spirit’s claw to create a magic crystal socket on them, unlocking an additional magic crystal slot.

➤ For outfits obtained outside the Pearl Shop, please check the [Special Outfits] page.

As for costumes, there are two types. Those you can obtain from the Pearl Shop, called functional costumes, and those you can craft yourself, called non-functional costumes.

The ones in the Pearl Shop, such as the treant camouflage set or the canape set, grant you useful special effects when worn. For example, a splat fisher’s clothes set will allow you to swim faster, and give you a small bonus for fishing. A da-dum da-dum diving suit set lets you dive for longer. The canape and pavilla costume sets allow you to perform cooking and alchemy at a faster rate.

Meanwhile, the ones you can craft yourself can only be obtained via a process described in the section Costume Exchange below.

They give less special effects, cannot be extracted for Valks’ cry or Cron stones, and cannot be sold once obtained. On the other hand, they can be heated to obtain special ancient spirit’s crystals which can then be infused with the magic crystal slot socket you unlock for an outfit armor piece.


Not all crystals can be equipped in the outfit crystal slot you’ve now unlocked.
You need to go through a special process to craft an ancient spirit’s crystal to infuse in this slot.

First, you need a non-functional costume, such as a Calpheon noble suit or dress. These can be purchased at the Central Market as normal armor equipment in the Crafted Clothes section, or can be made using workers at a town’s costume mill.

If you want to craft it yourself, the costume mill must be at least level 2, and you will require a design blueprint. You can purchase the design from Calpheon’s famed tailor, Merv, when your amity with her is 400 or higher.

➤ You can read more about town workshops in the [Crafting] page.

Once you have a Calpheon noble suit or dress ready, you can use an equipment tailoring coupon to exchange the armor piece for a costume. As said in the previous section, these coupons can be obtained from the Pearl Shop, the Central Market, or from events.

Right click the coupon in your pearl inventory, and select the Calpheon noble dress to exchange it for its costume iteration.Please note that when exchanging equipment this way, the existing clothes in the normal inventory will disappear, and a new Calpheon noble costume will be created in the pearl inventory.

Finally, if you heat the Calpheon noble costume through processing (hotkey: L), you will obtain an ancient spirit's crystal - swiftness. This, when infused, will increase your movement speed by +2.

Note that other costumes may give you different crystals, depending on each costume’s special effect. For example, a shroud knight armor (costume), when heated, will be turned into an ancient spirit's crystal - viper, which when infused will grant you +1 attack speed & casting speed.
Once this is done, your outfit magic crystal has been infused.

Please remember that unequipping the outfit piece with the crystal socket will gray out the outfit crystal slot, and you will lose its effects until you equip an outfit piece with the socket unlocked once again.

➤ You can read more about this feature in the [Magic Crystals] page.

Subtópico: Special Outfits

This page is for the different outfits that can be obtained via in-game methods, instead of purchasing them in the Pearl Shop. For the basics on outfits, please check the [Outfits & Costumes] page.

While the majority of outfits are obtained in the Pearl Shop, there are some that can be acquired within the game. Of these, many are normal equipment that can be transformed into an outfit by using a tailoring coupon. Outside of those, there are a few that do not require a tailoring coupon or any other transformative mechanic, but are directly obtained as outfits equipped to your characters’ appearance slots. These are Karlstein, La Orzeca, and Nouverikant.


As you wander around in the world of Black Desert, you might come across a peculiar item: Intricately Patterned Mystical Shard. These shards can be obtained all around the world at a very low chance when defeating monsters, and are needed as one of the ingredients to craft the Karlstein outfit.

With one of these shards in your possession, travel to Calpheon and speak with Rubin, the city herald. He will offer you the quest A Hero in Karlstein I. Follow this questline to learn who, or what, Karlstein is.Once you’ve finished the entire questline, NPC Clara Siciliano will offer you a daily quest to obtain the design item needed to craft the outfit, [Daily] To Become Karlstein.Congratulations, you’ve now unlocked the ability to obtain the design items.

After this, all you need to craft the outfit is all the required crafting materials for each outfit part and a purchased house set to be an Old Moon Mill. Houses with this functionality can be found in the cities of Heidel, Calpheon, Altinova, Grána, and Duvencrune.

During your stay in O’dyllita, the land claimed by the Ahib elves, you might have obtained a Quturan’s Ashen Leaf or Quturan’s Black Leaf, or if you’ve been incredibly lucky, a Quturan’s Left Lung or Quturan’s Right Lung. These items are needed to obtain the La Orzeca outfit based on the appearance of the black spirit.

Viorencia Odore, the queen of the Arid Land of O'dyllita, announced that she would grant the Orzecan relic known as the La Orzeca outfit to whoever brings her the lungs of the Quturan, the divine tree of the fallen ancient Kingdom of Orzeca.This outfit was made in Orzeca long ago, with the power of the Thornwood Goddess and in the image of the legendary incarnation of greed, in order to protect those wearing it from the untouchable reach of Hadum.

To start the quests to acquire this outfit, you will need either Quturan’s Left Lung x1 or Quturan’s Right Lung x1. The left lung is needed to obtain the La Orzeca Helmet, while the right lung is needed for the La Orzeca Armor. Together, they form the full La Orzeca outfit set.However, securing these two items is easier said than done. Due to the chance of coming across them being so low, you can also get them by performing simple alchemy (hotkey: L) on Quturan’s Ashen Leaf x100 → Quturan’s Right Lung x1, and Quturan’s Black Leaf x100 → Quturan’s Left Lung x1.

Once you’ve obtained either lung, go visit Azure Mantis from the Thornwood Watch in the Crypt of Resting Thoughts. Depending on what item you have, she will offer you one or another quest. Going through these, you will ultimately be rewarded with either La Orzeca Helmet Box or La Orzeca Armor Box. These can be opened by any class.

In case you want the outfit moved to another character, please visit the NPCs that gave you the boxes, either Burt Bedmountain or Limitte. They will have a daily quest to turn the item back into its box, allowing you to move it to a different character. Please be aware these quests can be done once per day, and completing them will cost you 1 billion silver.
– During your encounters against Bloodstorm Nouver, you might obtain items called Bloodstorm Nouver's Split Horn and Bloodstorm Nouver's Ragged Wing at a certain probability.As the items’ description suggests, if you take the horn and wing to the NPC Guest from Everfrost, found in Valencia City, you can exchange them via a quest for a Dormant Nouverikant Helmet (horn) and Dormant Nouverikant Armor (wing).

– Crafted as normal equipment without any power, this helmet and armor now need to be empowered through enhancement. You need to enhance these gear pieces to PEN (V). For this, you will need Bloodstorm Black Stones.Bloodstorm Black Stone x1 is obtained from heating (hotkey: L) Black Stone (Armor or Weapon) x100 + Bloodlit Eye of the Desert x1.Bloodlit Eye of the Desert is acquired at a certain chance when defeating Bloodstorm Nouver. It can also be obtained by exchanging additional ragged wings and split horns with the guest from Everfrost in Valencia City. Each ragged wing or split horn will reward you with Bloodlit Eye of the Desert x30.Note that enhancement attempts on dormant Nouverikant pieces are guaranteed to succeed, but the number of bloodstorm black stones needed for each enhancement level will increase.

You will need a total of Bloodstorm Black Stone x210, which is equal to Bloodlit Eye of the Desert x210 and Black Stone (Armor or Weapon) x21,000 to enhance each dormant gear piece to PEN (V).For both pieces, you will need to double the amount: Bloodlit Eye of the Desert x420 and Black Stone (Armor or Weapon) x42,000.

– Once you’ve obtained the PEN (V) Dormant Nouverikant Helmet and PEN (V) Dormant Nouverikant Armor, you need to transform them into a usable form for your class. For this, you will require Unstable Nouver Core x3 and Cantarnia's Crystal x30 per piece.The unstable core is acquired from heating Concentrated Boss’ Aura x1 + Nouver’s Latent Aura x10. The first is acquired from heating unenhanced boss gear, while the second is dropped from the world boss Nouver in any of its forms.Cantarnia’s crystals are purchased from Francia, the chief librarian of O’draxxia. Each crystal costs 500 million silver. This means that for both pieces you will need a total of 60 Cantarnia’s Crystal, or 30 billion silver saved up to purchase them.

Use the manufacture processing option (hotkey: L) with those 3 items to obtain either Sealed Nouverikant Armor or Sealed Nouverikant Helmet.

– Open the sealed Nouverikant armor or helmet with the character of your choice. You’re now the owner of the Nouverikant outfit!

Subtópico: Alchemy Stone
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
An alchemy stone is an item you can equip as part of your equipment. Once activated (hotkey: U), the alchemy stone will give beneficial effects for a limited period of time. You can only equip one alchemy stone at a time. However, depending on the situation, you can always swap different alchemy stones. The three types of Alchemy Stones are destruction, protection, and life. You’ll receive offensive, defensive, and life skill-related benefits respectively when you activate each type. The quality of the beneficial effect will vary depending on the grade and level of the alchemy stone. There are 4 grades and 8 levels available for most alchemy stones.

Crafting these magical stones would be considered the final stage of the alchemy life skill. Not only is it difficult to craft them, but it is also difficult to increase their grade and level once crafted.However, the benefits of equipping a high grade and level alchemy stone are equivalent to enhancing equipment to its next enhancement level.

It is a good idea to learn the basics of alchemy before you try crafting an alchemy stone.




The option to craft alchemy stones is available for all Adventurers, even if their alchemy level is beginner 1.You’ll need to use an alchemy tool installed in a residence of your property, and use the required materials to craft an alchemy stone. Out of the materials needed to craft one, the most important ingredient is shining powder. You can obtain it with a low chance when you successfully carry out any alchemical operation.In addition to shining powder you also need sinner’s blood, powder of time, pure powder reagent, and clear liquid reagent. You will randomly receive a destruction, protection, or life alchemy stone from a successful alchemy craft with those ingredients.There is also a probability that you’ll obtain a broken alchemy stone shard from a successful alchemy craft. Although you can’t use this item for anything, you can sell it to an NPC shop for 5,000 silver.

As mentioned previously, any Adventurer at any alchemy level will have the option to attempt to craft an alchemy stone. However, your chances of successfully crafting them is correlated to your alchemy level. This means the higher the alchemy level, the higher your chances of successfully crafting an alchemy stone.




Not all alchemy stones are equal. The grade of an alchemy stone is distinguished by the color of its name and tooltip, and the level by the prefix found in the name.Similar to equipment quality grades, the ones in white name are of the lowest grade. The grades, from the lowest to the highest, are in the following order: white, green, blue, and yellow.

The level stage of an alchemy stone is indicated by the prefix found in the item’s name.The levels, from the lowest to highest quality, are in the following order: imperfect, rough, polished, sturdy, sharp, resplendent, and shining.

Don’t be disappointed if you have a low grade and level alchemy stone. For that, you can use the polishing and growth features to increase its grade and level.


Although difficult to craft, a high grade and level alchemy stone yields enormous benefits.


After you equip the Alchemy Stone to the equipment slot, press U to activate the Alchemy Stone and receive the beneficial effect. The durability of the Alchemy Stone will decrease by 1 every time it is activated. The duration of the beneficial effects from destruction and protection alchemy stones is 5 minutes. The cooldown time is also 5 minutes. The duration and cooldown of life stones is 10 minutes.Since destruction and protection stones share the same cooldown time, it is not possible to receive the two types of beneficial effects at the same time.

As all stones share duration and cooldown time, you can use all of them consecutively when the cooldown time resets, or tick the Auto-use Alchemy Stone option box beneath the equipment slot area to auto-use it. However, make sure to remember to untick the option when you no longer need its effects. Otherwise, you might waste all of the stone’s durability without realizing it.

You can use the recharge feature to restore the lost durability of one of these stones by using oil, blood, and reagents. The amount of oil needed to recharge a stone will depend on the level of this one. But since there is no limit in the type of oil and blood used, it is relatively easy to craft and obtain them.

The use of alchemy stones and the recharge feature is not limited by your alchemy level. Unless your goal is to make an alchemy stone of the highest quality through the polishing and growth features, there is no demerit for not continuing to level up your alchemy life skill.



Go to your character’s inventory (hotkey: I) → Stone button. As said above, the amount of materials required to recharge a stone will vary depending on the lost durability value and the level of the stone.



When you upgrade an alchemy stone, it will increase the quality of the existing beneficial effects or it’ll increase the types of beneficial effects available. Before you can use the growth feature, you need to use the polishing feature to increase the alchemy stone’s EXP (80%~150%). The reason behind this is that the growth option can only be used once the alchemy stone’s EXP is 80% or higher. Additionally, the higher the alchemy stone’s EXP, the better the success rate.

The polishing feature provides EXP to an alchemy stone. The polishing material will vary depending on the type of alchemy stone.
• To polish destruction stones, you need to use ores.• To polish protection stones, you need to use plywood.• To polish life stones, you need to use crops.



After you increase the alchemy stone’s EXP to the 80%~150% range, you can use one black stone (weapon) to perform growth. When the growth attempt is successful, either the grade (color) or level (name prefix) will improve. Sometimes, with a low chance, there is a possibility that both the grade and level improve.

As said previously, when the grade increases the types of beneficial effects available will increase. If the level increases, the quality of the existing beneficial effects will increase.When you successfully increase the grade and/or level of the alchemy stone, its EXP will reset back to 0%.

As the level of an alchemy stone increases, you’ll have to further raise your own character’s alchemy level to continue being able to improve it.


The grade (color) will not decrease for failing growth. However, there is a chance that the level (name prefix) will decrease for failed growth attempt.

You also will lose alchemy stone’s EXP for failed growth attempts. The amount of EXP lost is half of your existing EXP. For example, if you have 150%, you will lose half of the current EXP, making it 75% EXP for a failed attempt. If you have 80% EXP, but fail, then you will have 40% EXP remaining.

When performing growth on resplendent and splendid alchemy stones, the stones themselves can be destroyed from failed growth attempts.



To the right you can see the different possible improvements the alchemy stone can obtain when attempting growth on it.

Not only is it costly to perform growth, but there is a chance that the level will decrease for failed growth attempts. As such, always keep in mind the cost of attempting to improve an alchemy stone.



There are alchemy stones that do not follow the rules and methods explained in previous sections. Spirit stones cannot be recharged, and once spent they cannot be used anymore.

The more well-known varieties of these stones can be acquired in the land of the elves, Kamasylvia, by defeating the local monsters. They are the destruction, guardian, and life spirit stones, and come in both green and blue grades.

Another type of spirit stones can be synthesized via alchemy, and like the previous ones they cannot be recharged. These are green, blue, and yellow-grade stones of the following levels: sharp (green, blue, yellow), resplendent (yellow), splendid (yellow), and shining (yellow). Only protection (defensive-oriented) and destruction (offensive-oriented) stones of this type can be currently acquired.

To craft them, you will need to reach alchemy mastery 500, and be at a certain alchemy level depending on the stone you want to craft. The ingredients are difficult and costly to obtain, and as such you could say these stones are reserved for the most dedicated of Adventurers.

Subtópico: Extraction
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
Black stones, magic crystals, Caphras stones, reform stones, and lightstones are all valuable materials that can be reused once extracted.

Alternatively, you can also obtain Cron stones or Valks’ cry items by extracting them from pearl outfits.

Talk to the Blacksmith NPCs in cities to check the different extraction options.




◈ Black Stones
You can get back black stones used to enhance your equipment through the Extract Black Stone option in the extraction menu.

You are guaranteed to get all the black stones used within the safe enhancement bracket. For instance, you can safely enhance weapons up to +7, and defense gear up to +5 with a 100% success rate.For equipment that has been enhanced beyond the safety enhancement range, instead of all of them, only a certain amount of black stones will be extracted.

Additionally, as there’s always a chance to fail enhancements outside of the safe enhancement range, you’ll realize how inefficient it is to extract black stones from equipment pieces of high enhancement level, if you consider all the black stones that have been consumed on failed enhancement attempts.Due to this, the most efficient way to use black stones you might want back, would be to only enhance equipment pieces up to the highest safe enhancement level, then extract them when you want to switch them. This way, you won’t lose any black stone.



Please note that the item you're extracting black stones from will be destroyed in the process.

➤ You can read more about this feature in the [Enhancement] page.


◈ Magic Crystals
To extract magic crystals from your crystal inventory, you need either a crystal extraction tool or a black spirit essence.

You can obtain a crystal extraction tool once per week in the Loyalties tab of the Pearl Shop, and can craft your own once you’ve completed the quest Techthon and the Crystal Extraction Tool given by Techthon once a character is Lv. 50.As crafting these is expensive, it is recommended to only make your own when you need to extract the more expensive magic crystals.

Black spirit essences are available in the Pearl Shop.



Please be aware that removing a magic crystal from your crystal inventory without any of these two items will result in the magic crystal being destroyed.

➤ You can read more about this topic in the [Magic Crystals] page.


◈ Outfits
You can extract Valks’ cry and Cron stones from pearl outfits obtained from the Pearl Shop, login rewards, and events.



Valks’ cry is an item that when used will increase your enhancement chance by +1.You can use up to 10 of them in order to increase your character’s enhancement chance by a total of +10 per stack. This value is separated from your regular enhancement chance, and is added on top of it. Completing Adventure Logs will raise this maximum number.

Cron stones are used when enhancing equipment pieces of DUO enhancement level or above. It keeps the piece at its current enhancement level even if the enhancement attempt fails. Otherwise, the enhancement level will drop.The amount of Cron stones required depends on the item you're enhancing.

Read the item’s tooltip to see how many Valks’ cry and Cron stones you can get from it.



Functional costumes like desert camouflage, treant camouflage, and others cannot be extracted, therefore, you cannot get Valks’ cry or Cron stones from them.

➤ You can read more about this type of equipment in the [Outfits & Costumes] page.


◈ Caphras Stones
Caphras stones can be extracted from equipment improved with Caphras enhancement.

When extracting Caphras stones, only 95% of the Caphras stones infused into the equipment piece are extracted.In addition, 100,000 silver are paid for each Caphras stone to be extracted.




After you’ve extracted the Caphras stones from the equipment piece, the item will not be destroyed, and its normal enhancement level will be kept. However, it will lose all the bonuses obtained from Caphras enhancement.

➤ You can read more about this in the [Caphras Enhancement] page.


◈ Reform Stones
Equipment that has been upgraded via the use of reform stones can be returned to its original state by extracting the reform stone.Extracting the reform stone is also necessary if you want to sell the equipment piece.

Certain materials are consumed when extracting these stones, and the type of material consumed depends on the type of equipment.Please check the table below for details.

Equipment Type
Extraction Material
Ultimate Weapon / Defense Gear / Sunset Artina Sol
Restoration Stone
Combatant's Tuvala Gear
Combatant's Restoration Stone
Obsidian Blackstar Gear
Mirror of Equilibrium
Heart-infused (Fiery, Storm Devoured, etc) Weapons
Cup-infused (Moonlit, Starlit, etc) Accessories
Refined Essence of Emotions

– Restoration stones and combatant’s restoration stones can be purchased from any blacksmith in a city.– Mirror of Equilibrium can be purchased from Hughol, Duvencrune’s blacksmith, at its original price, and for double that price in other town blacksmiths throughout the world.– Refined essence of emotions must be crafted. It requires Fragment of All Creation x10, Legacy of the Ancient x10, Forest Fury x10, Fused Crystal of Emotions x20, Magical Shard x100.

Additionally, a mirror of equilibrium can extract blessed & exalted alchemy stones and gauche master matchlocks, but keep in mind their reform stone will be destroyed in the process. Instead, you will only receive a single ingredient item from the many you needed to originally create the reform stone.




◈ Lightstones
You can extract lightstones infused into artifacts with a lightstone extraction tool.This tool can be purchased from any blacksmith in a town, and each one costs 10 million silver.

– How to Convert an Artifact → Purified Lightstone

Use Simple Alchemy (hotkey: L) with Artifact x1 to obtain Purified Lightstone x1-2

Use the Simple Alchemy with Artifact x1, Ancient Power - Red Shard x1, Ancient Seal – Black Shard x1 to obtain Purified Lightstone x2-3

If you remove or replace the lightstones infused in any artifact after copying it, it does not affect the copy held by the other character.

Please note that you cannot extract any infused lightstones in artifacts copied via the item copy function. You can only either remove or destroy them.





◈ Lightstones


Lightstones are items that you can infuse into artifacts to get additional effects. The additional effects of lightstones are applied when you equip artifacts that are infused with them.

Once the combination of the lightstones infused into your equipped artifacts meet a certain condition, you can additionally get lightstone combination effects.

Lightstones can be sorted into 4 main categories.• Lightstone of Fire: attack type• Lightstone of Earth: defense type• Lightstone of Wind: special type• Lightstone of Flora: life skill type



◈ How to Obtain
Lightstones can be obtained either by using purified lightstones, or directly from quests, world bosses, and more.

Subtópico: Guaranteed PEN (V) Boss Gear
Conteúdo do Subtópico:


You can get the quests to get PEN (V) boss gear via NPC Jetina, found in all cities.

You can get up to 7 different pieces of PEN (V) boss gear through Jetina by upgrading: main weapon, sub-weapon, awakening weapon, helmet, armor, gloves, and shoes (once per family).

Please note that characters that have negative karma cannot equip TET (IV) gear obtained from these quests.

Note that the equipment is obtained at max enhancement level, and that it cannot be registered for sale on the Central Market. The obtainable PEN (V) boss gear pieces are as follows:
– Main Weapon: PEN (V) Kzarka main weapon or PEN (V) Offin Tett main weapon– Sub-weapon: PEN (V) Nouver sub-weapon or PEN (V) Kutum sub-weapon– Awakening Weapon: PEN (V) Dandelion awakening weapon – Helmet: PEN (V) Giath's Helmet or PEN (V) Griffon's Helmet– Gloves: PEN (V) Bheg's Gloves or PEN (V) Leebur's Gloves– Armor: PEN (V) Dim Tree Spirit's Armor or PEN (V) Red Nose's Armor– Shoes: PEN (V) Urugon's Shoes or PEN (V) Muskan's Shoes

Important!
The appropriate pieces can be upgraded to Slumbering Origin gear when they reach Lv. 10 Caphras enhancement levels. You can read more about this type of equipment in the [Crafting Slumbering Origin Gear] page.

Requirements– Lv. 60 or higher character.– Complete the quest A Cry for Help from the Suggested tab of the Quest window (hotkey: O), offered via the Black Spirit, as well as the quest Old Moon Guild's Trade Offer.

You can start the PEN (V) boss gear questline by going to the Suggested tab via the Black Spirit with a character that meets the requirements and accepting the quest [PEN (V) Boss Gear] The Best Deal.



If you cannot find the quest, remember to check to see if you have completed the quests A Cry for Help and Old Moon Guild's Trade Offer.

To proceed with the quests to receive reformable TET (IV) boss gear, you need either PEN (V) Tuvala gear that was converted to be usable by normal characters, or TET (IV) boss gear.

Please note that season characters cannot do these quests.

The following gear can be exchanged with Jetina to get the upgradeable TET (IV) boss gear:– PEN (V) Tuvala gear (converted)– TET (IV) boss gear



Hand over a TET (IV) boss gear or PEN (V) Tuvala gear to get an upgradeable piece of boss gear through the Old Moon’s resplendent gear quests offered by Jetina.When you hand over a TET (IV) boss gear, you will get the upgradeable version of the same TET (IV) boss gear.When you hand over PEN (V) Tuvala gear, you can choose one of the pieces of boss gear available for that slot.

e.g.)- Hand over a TET (IV) Giath's Helmet = Get an upgradable TET (IV) Giath's Helmet- Hand over a PEN (V) Tuvala Helmet = Pick either the upgradeable TET (IV) Giath's Helmet or the Griffon's Helmet.

Note that you can exchange only once per gear slot per family.

You cannot have Caphras enhancement done on the gear pieces, and you cannot register the item on the Central Market. Once you exchange an item for a specific gear slot, then you cannot exchange it for another item of the same slot.



Weapons are given as boxes, so you can move them to the character you want.

Upgradeable TET (IV) boss gear can be upgraded from Reform Lv. I to V using special reform stones.There are different reform stones for each piece of boss gear. The reform stones that have the same boss name as the gear can be used to upgrade the gear.e.g.) Kzarka weapons can be upgraded with Kzarka reform stones.



The reform stones can be made by “Heating” all the required items in the Processing (L) window.


You will need to use the matching concentrated boss crystal and concentrated boss aura as materials for each of the boss gear.e.g) For Kzarka weapons, you will need the concentrated Kzarka crystal.

If you made the wrong reform stone, then you can use grinding in the Processing window to get the materials back.

How to Obtain the Materials for the Gear Reform Stones

The “concentrated ___ crystal” items can be obtained by defeating the named boss monster or as a reward from Jetina’s weekly quests.
You will get 1 to 15 of the crystals by defeating the boss monsters, depending on the boss, and 155 of them by completing the weekly quest (resets every Thursday).

You can use Caphras Enhancement on your PEN (V) Boss Gear, or use it to craft the Fallen God’s Armor, but cannot register it on the Central Market.

If you haven’t upgraded your exchanged boss gear, you can opt to exchange one piece per slot for a different type of boss gear per family.e.g.) Upgradeable TET (IV) Dim Tree Spirit’s Armor → Upgradeable TET (IV) Red Nose’s Armor

Important!Once you have completed the quest Old Moon Guild's Trade Offer, and your character is Lv. 60 or higher, you can do the quest [PEN (V) Boss Gear] The Best Deal to obtain guaranteed PEN (V) boss equipment.Through a slightly different method also offered by Jetina, you can work your way to get PEN (V) boss gear without leaving things to chance.

➤ Please check out the [Guaranteed PEN (V) Boss Gear] page for a full explanation of this feature.


Select one of the three to enhance up to PEN (V). If you’re not sure which one to get, and you have no better rings, the Ring of Crescent Guardian tends to be recommended.
Once you accept and start the Old Moon Guild Trade Offer quest, you can select and receive one of either a Ring of Crescent Guardian, Narc Ear Accessory, or Tungrad Earring that are not yet enhanced and cannot be registered on the Central Market. From this moment, you can use the special materials for guaranteed enhancement to enhance your accessory up to PEN (V).



The following are the materials needed for improving your guaranteed enhancement accessory.


Please refer to the following section for information on how to obtain materials to create these special black stones.


The Burning Moonlight Black Stone is a material exclusively used to enhance accessories for guaranteed enhancement from PRI (I) to TET (IV).
You can obtain these stones via the simple alchemy processing option (hotkey: L).

Simple Alchemy Formula for Burning Moonlight Black Stones
– Burning Moonlight Black Stone Powder x1– Yona's Fragment x1– Magical Shard x3– Black Stone (Weapon) x100 or Black Stone (Armor) x100– Old Moon Alchemy Catalyst x10

You can obtain this item by defeating monsters in the territory of Valencia, or via heating (hotkey: L) yellow grade accessories.

Accessories you can heat to obtain Yona’s fragments: Tungrad Necklace, Ogre Ring, Laytenn‘s Power Stone, Serap's Necklace, Sicil's Necklace, Black Distortion Earring, Tungrad Earring, Narc Ear Accessory, Tungrad Belt, Orkinrad's Belt, Valtarra Eclipsed Belt, Centaurus Belt, Basilisk's Belt, Tungrad Ring, Eye of the Ruins Ring, Ring of Crescent Guardian, Forest Ronaros Ring, Ring of Cadry Guardian.
You can usually obtain these items by defeating monsters or in many other ways. Can also be purchased from the Central Market.
Please check the [Crafting Notes] page for more information on how to search & obtain items.

Old Moon Alchemy Catalyst


You can purchase this item for 3.5 million silver each from an Old Moon Guild Manager NPC vendor, found in most cities.


You can obtain the item required for enhancing accessories from TET (IV) to PEN (V) as a reward for completing a quest from Jetina.



You can proceed with the quest if you have a TET (IV) accessory with guaranteed enhancement in your inventory.


The TRI (III) accessory required to complete the quest is a normal one you can obtain via traditional methods, such as the Central Market or enhancement, and it has to be the same type of item as the TET (IV) enhanced accessory you have that cannot be registered on the Central Market.E.g.) If you have enhanced your “Ring of Crescent Guardian” obtained from Jetina’s quest up to TET (IV), you must hand over a TRI (III) Ring of Crescent Guardian.

Accessories that are guaranteed for enhancement can be exchanged for other accessories, for free, up to two times per family.



You can exchange your guaranteed enhancement TET (IV) or PEN (V) accessory in your character’s inventory via Jetina’s [EXC] A New Choice I and [EXC] A New Choice II quests.

You can immediately enhance your accessory up to PEN (V) when you hand over a PEN (V) accessory, since you’ll get a TET (IV) accessory and a Dancing Moonlight Black Stone x1.

These quests for exchanging a TET (IV) or PEN (V) enhanced accessory can only be completed twice per family. That being said, once you’ve done them, you gain access to the [Daily] New Choice quests. In exchange for 2 billion silver, Jetina will continue to offer the accessory exchange option once per day.

Subtópico: Crafting Blackstar Gear
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
You will need Remnants of the Rift, a strange substance which you can obtain at a low chance by defeating the bosses that emerge from dark rifts. You can also purchase Remnants of the Rift from the Central Market.

➤ You can read more about the Dark Rift feature in the [Dark Rifts] page.
There are a total of 13 quests, which, for an Adventurer who has already completed Mediah’s main questline, will be a rather quick task to complete. They will introduce you to Dorin Morgrim, the only blacksmith capable, and mad enough, to craft Blackstar equipment for you.
Once you’ve obtained the Remnants of the Rift and learned about the Three Legendary Blacksmiths of Mediah, you have completed the prerequisites to accept the quests that lead to crafting Blackstar gear. Yet, to progress through these quests and finish crafting this equipment, there are a few additional items required. Those are Concentrated Boss's Aura, and Specter's Energy.
4. Specter's Energy

To craft all types of Blackstar equipment except for the main weapon, you will require Specter’s Energy. While other items you can easily obtain from purchasing them on the Central Market or from a quest reward, this item is the most difficult material to acquire due to its low chance to drop, as it can only be obtained from defeating monsters.

Defeating monsters in the following monster zones has a slightly higher chance to drop Specter’s Energy: Protty Cave, Sherekhan Necropolis (Night), Sycraia Underwater Ruins (Upper), and Thornwood Forest.

Combining the Venomous Night Fang items obtained from looting monsters throughout O’dyllita into a [+] shape will create the Ibedor’s Scroll item, which you can use to summon a boss that has a low chance of dropping Specter’s Energy.

Follow the quests to investigate the nature of the mysterious Blackstar located in northwestern Calpheon, and the life that lies therein.

Throughout the journey you’ll be offered a crossroads quest where you can select the route best appropriate for your difficulty level based on your personal AP/DP. Adventurers with high AP can face a powerful boss monster in a quick bout, while Adventurers with lower AP can instead deal with a large number of monsters in a monster zone, then face a weakened version of the same boss monster.

– If you cannot obtain the first quest for a Blackstar equipment piece from Martha Kiyen, check if you have already started the quests for another piece. As they all interact with the same items, you can only do the first few quests of each equipment slot piece separately one by one.
– When the time comes to face the boss monster, we recommend Adventurers to not have more than one Blackstar questline active at that stage, as you may sacrifice the Eye of Desolation for the wrong quest.
– Additionally, if you’re at that stage of a Blackstar questline and cannot summon the boss monster when sacrificing the Eye of Desolation in the brazier, please check that you don’t already have any [Combat] The Incarnation of Corruption at Star's End or similar quest active. As all related quests involve interacting with the same brazier, you cannot progress more than one of them at the same time.
In closing, here are the words of an Adventurer who crafted the Blackstar gear:"Crafting Blackstar gear is not so difficult! If you have Specter’s Energy, that is…’

Fallen God’s Armor requires one of the three specific armors below, and an item called Flame of Despair.There are three armors that may be used as a crafting material for Fallen God’s Armor.
• PEN (V) Red Nose’s Armor + Caphras Lv. 10• PEN (V) Dim Tree Spirit’s Armor + Caphras Lv. 10• PEN (V) Blackstar Armor

Please note that reformed Blackstar equipment (Obsidian Blackstar Armor) cannot be used.

To learn where to obtain the different boss equipment pieces, please check the [World Bosses] and [Field Bosses] pages.For Blackstar equipment, please check the [Crafting Blackstar Gear] page.

After acquiring the armor piece that meets the conditions above, you need a second material called Flame of Despair.

The flame of despair can be obtained by gathering Embers of Despair x100 and heating them in the Processing window (hotkey: L).Defeating the Turos of Tunkuta will drop embers of despair at a certain rate.In the Tunkuta monster zone, Grand Chief of Turos, Ulutuka appears at a certain chance when “Ulutuka's Alert” is activated, or when two intruders have been found to trespass. From defeating Ulutuka you may obtain the flame of despair.
Both the flame of despair and embers of despair can also be obtained at a certain rate by defeating boss monsters summoned through Ibedor's Scroll. You can acquire Ibedor’s scroll by arranging x5 Venomous Night Fang into a [+] shape. These fangs are dropped by defeated monsters all over O’dyllita.

Be careful when you venture into Tunkuta or the overall territory of O’dyllita, because these areas require high AP and DP levels. We recommend these monster zones only for seasoned adventurers.
Fallen God’s Armor 2nd Material

Flame of Despair
There is another, less known method to obtain Fallen God’s Armor.Rumors say that in the monster zones of O’dyllita one can obtain fragments of an eye-shaped artifact related to the fallen god of Star’s End, and a flame that burns and corrupts all that it touches.

This corrupted artifact, together with a Caphras Stone imbued with the substance from dark rifts, is all Dorin Morgrim needs to craft the much sought-after Slumbering Origin armor piece.

Subtópico: Navigation
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
Navigation
Since Black Desert is made up of vast worlds,
A convenient navigation system to suit the world is offered.
If you designate a destination on the world map a navigation guide appears,
And the guide gets displayed to the destination even in the normal game screen.
If you just look at the world map closely, you won’t get lost anywhere.
Also, if you press the automatic move (shortcut ‘T’) in the situation above,
The character automatically moves to the destination without control.

Activating navigation in the World
It is very easy to activate navigation.

Open the world map, (shortcut ‘M’), and right click anywhere on the area you want.
Then a light pillar appears on the point where it is right clicked, and a guideline to the destination gets activated.
If you close the world map afterwards, you can see the navigation guide getting activated around the character.
If you just follow the navigation guide, you will be able to reach the destination easily.


Changing the navigation from activated state to deactivated state is also similar.
Open the world map again, and if you right click anywhere with your mouse, it changes to deactivated state.
This deactivation can be done by right clicking the mouse anywhere on the mini map, excluding the world map.

Quest destination guide
Navigation can be used in normal state like number 1,
But it has amplified effect if it is used in a quest.

When you get a quest, the currently ongoing quest list appears on the right of the screen, and if you right click your mouse cursor on the quest name the navigation to the destination gets activated.
Or if you put your mouse upon the quest tracker, a red and yellow button appears at the end of the name.
The red button is navigation activation towards the destination,
And the yellow button is navigation activation as well as the automatic movement towards the destination.


▲ If you right click the mouse on the icon of the world map quest destination, navigation is activated.


World map icon
If you open the world map and look at towns, you can see various icons on the screen.
These icons show the locations of NPC, monsters and the area,
And if you right click after the putting mouse cursor on the icon, the navigation towards the destination is activated.


Item
For some items that can be earned from Black Desert world,
Navigations are sometimes provided.
In case of summon scrolls that summon monster, you have to go to a particular area,
And if you right click after putting the mouse cursor on the icon the navigation towards the destination is activated.
If you reach the destination with that navigation guide, then you can use the item.




Talk with NPC
There are numerous numbers of NPCs in Black Desert world.
Sometimes when you are talking to these NPCs, you can see a phrase that says “Navigation has been activated” on the chat window.
Sometimes you can see a command saying “Go to the place located on world map”.
After you end this conversation, you can see that navigation has been activated.
If you follow this, you can earn what the NPC wants.
Node
There are nodes in each area of the Black Desert.
If you right click your mouse cursor on this node, the navigation to relevant node manager NPC gets activated.
Sometimes it’s difficult to find a node manager, but you can find them easily through this function.
Also, after pressing [Node management] button after talking node manager,
If there is no previous node that connects with the relevant node, a message that says ‘Connection to the previous node is required’ appears.
If you click this button at this time, the navigation to a closest node that connects to the relevant node gets activated.
By backtracking this, you can easily connect the node to a point you want.

Subtópico: Central Market
Conteúdo do Subtópico:


① Basic Information: Shows the silver you have in the market’s warehouse, this one’s volume capacity, a button to manage it and move items between your inventory, the town storage, and the warehouse, and the market silver collection percentage benefit you possess. Depending on the amount of family fame you have, you will be able to collect extra silver from your sales in the market.

② Buy & Sell: The image above shows the Buy menu. Here you can select a category of item until you find the one you want to purchase, or manually search for it. The Sell menu will show you the items you have stored in your warehouse and their current average price for sale, recent purchases/sales you’ve made, other market notifications, and a list of the items you currently have listed for sale (Sell tab) and pre-ordered for purchase (Buy tab).

③ Item Categories: Shows the different categories of items. Each category has its own subcategories you can access by clicking on them.

④ Item List: Shows items that are currently listed or able to be listed on the Central Market. You can click on an item on this list to open its purchase window.

⑤ Search Type: You can choose to search through all categories or just within the category you’ve selected. ⑥ Search Bar: Enter the name of an item to search it. Modified by the search type you’ve selected.

⑦ Status: Opens a window where you can see the items you have listed for sale and your pending pre-orders of items. It is the same as the Sell & Buy tab of the Sell menu.
To purchase and sell items in the Central Market, you must have silver to purchase them, and need to have the items you want to sell, both stored in your warehouse.

You can access and manage your warehouse through the Central Market Director NPCs or via transaction maids/butlers. The Central Market directors can be found in the main cities & town of every territory.

There are various methods to deposit silver to your personal Central Market warehouse.
Seen above is the Central Market window that is displayed when using a transaction maid/butler.
The Manage Warehouse window when using the Central Market through both Central Market Director and Storage Keeper NPCs is the same one, with only one difference: via those two types of NPCs you will also be able to move items from the town’s storage.

Your personal warehouse for the Central Market is capped at 5,000 VT, but can be gradually expanded for another 2,000 VT as your family fame increases.

You can move up to 200 VT of a single type of item to and from the warehouse at a time using a transaction maid/butler. The item description for each item has the warehouse volume of the item. Keep in mind that the warehouse volume for an item and its natural weight might not coincide.

The Central Market warehouse is shared by all characters of a family across all territories throughout Black Desert’s world.
You can register items for sale on the Central Market in the Sell window after you select the price and the number of items of that type you want to sell. In the example above, x440 Bottle of River Water are being registered for sale. At an individual price of 6,250 silver each, the total amount will be 2,750,000 silver. Once you’ve put an item for sale, you have to wait for a buyer to purchase it. Once that happens, you will receive the sale’s silver.However, if you’re selling an item to a pre-order, like seen in the image above where it says there are 54,445 orders placed for a Bottle of River Water at 6,250 silver each, the item will be sold immediately to one of those pre-orders, and you will equally fast receive the sale’s silver.

The Central Market takes a 30% commission for each sale, and each territory takes 5% per sale, for a total of 35% that is reduced from the total value of the sale. This means you’ll collect 65% of the selling price. This quantity of silver is automatically sent to your warehouse.

However, if you have a Value Pack then you can collect an additional 30%, which sums up to 84.5% of the total selling price.


◈ Old Moon Trade Pass
These trading passes issued by the Old Moon Guild give a buff of +5% Central Market silver collection for one transaction. They’re obtained from exchanging a rare item with any Old Moon Guild Manager NPC.

When used, the Old Moon Trade Pass is consumed. The applied effects of its use can be checked in the Central Market interface.The Old Moon Trade Pass effects are applied during the sale of an item, not during the sale’s silver collection. This means, the effect is linked to the act of selling the item.

The effects of the trade pass can be applied to a single item (x1 Bottle of River Water) or stackable items (x100 Bottle of River Water). The pass’ effects will also work when partially collecting the silver.

However, the effects will disappear when the item is withdrawn from the list of items listed for sale. This means that, if you apply the trade pass to an item, put it on sale at a certain price, and later you change the price of the item (because it went up, for example), the effect of the trade pass will be lost, as changing the price of a listed item for sale is an act of re-listing the item.

Do note that the effect of this pass does not stack with benefits from a Rich Merchant's Ring, and that the Central Market silver collection increase effect does not apply to Pearl Item transactions.


◈ Purchasing Items

You spend the silver stored in your warehouse when you purchase items from the Central Market. Therefore, you need to have sufficient silver in your warehouse at all times if you want to make any purchase.

Once you have enough silver in your warehouse, select the item you want to buy. After this, select the price at which you want to purchase the item, and then press the Buy button.





If the item is in stock, you’ll get it immediately (if there is 1 or more of it on the Central Market).

If the item is not in stock, then a pre-order for it will be placed. The Central Market will take your silver at this point.When another Adventurer lists the item to be sold on the Central Market later, the Adventurer that placed their pre-order at the highest price will get it first. If there are multiple Adventurers that placed the highest pre-order at the same price, then the item is sold randomly.



Above you can see several orders placed for different items.If the Central Market​​​​​​​ updates the top prices for items you’ve pre-ordered, you can re-list the items at new prices.

Canceling a placed pre-order will return you the silver spent.

Subtópico: Amity
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
Amity is the value that shows the friendliness you have with an NPC, and is family-wide.

You can increase your amity with an NPC by having a conversation in the field that NPC is interested in, or by greeting them. Certain quests will also increase your amity with them.

However, if you get caught stealing from them or doing an action that the NPC doesn’t like, your amity with them will decrease.



When you interact with an NPC (hotkey: R), their interaction interface will open. In the top left corner of this window you will see their name, your amity with them, and what can be unlocked by raising it. In this case, you can see that at 150 amity points you can unlock a knowledge entry from Crio, the fish vendor of Velia, and at 200 and 400 points a couple of quests.



Your amity with the NPC is also shown in the top left corner of the screen when having a conversation with them.


◈ Amity Reward
When your amity with an NPC goes up, you may be rewarded.

Some of these rewards consume energy, such as learning a knowledge entry, or receiving a temporary buff, while others are more straightforward, such as an NPC trusting you enough to request of you a new quest.

Some knowledge entries can be only obtained via increasing your amity with a given NPC, and there are many merchants that only sell valuable items to customers they trust.

When your amity with NPCs goes up, your territorial fame does as well.Territorial fame is the sum of all amity earned from NPCs that live in a given territory. When it goes up, information on various knowledge entries that can be earned only in that territory can be more easily obtained.



When you go near an NPC, your amity value with them and the NPC’s amity-related functions are shown in a big circle.




◈ Conversation
Although there are various ways to increase amity, the easiest and more efficient way is through conversation.You can start a conversation with an NPC by clicking on the Conversation button on their interface screen. You will be asked to fulfill a requirement by the end of the conversation round, and if you do not succeed you won’t get any amity reward.

Additionally, you need to possess both enough energy to invest in the conversation, and to know enough topics the NPC is interested in.



The more knowledge entries you obtain during your journey, the more topics of conversation you’ll possess when the time comes to converse with NPCs.

On the left side of the NPC interface screen you will see the list of conversation topics the NPC is interested in. In the example above, the NPC is interested in topics of the Serendia Adventure Journal III, of which the Adventurer owns 16 entries out of a total of 21.



When you obtain enough interest knowledge, the topics the NPC is interested in, you can start a conversation with them. Every time you start a conversation with an NPC, you spend a certain amount of energy. This amount of energy depends on the amity you have with the NPC. On the conversation screen the relevant NPC’s constellation picture will appear.Right click the knowledge entries located on the bottom circle, or drag and drop them, to select them for the conversation round. Once the constellation has been completed, the conversation takes place.



During a conversation there are two main attributes for every entry: interest level and favor. The interaction effects are based on how much the topic sparks interest in the NPC, and their favor.The interest level is related to success rate, and favor is related to the amity that is obtained after the conversation has concluded.

When a conversation is successful, you are given the option to carry out consecutive conversations. Energy is not spent on consecutive conversations, so if you succeed you can obtain more amity than you would get by conversing with them again separately, but if you fail, you will also lose the gained amity from the previous consecutive conversation, so you must be careful.




◈ Horoscope
When you have the same horoscope constellation with an NPC, it is easier to increase amity with them. For example, you start at amity 10 instead of 1 on your first encounter, and the amount of amity gained during conversation is increased.

An NPC horoscope constellation can be checked through the background picture that appears when having a conversation with them.



In the example above, the NPC’s horoscope constellation is the hammer.


◈ Greeting
Another way to increase your amity with an NPC is by exchanging greetings with them. It is a slower method, and involves an equal exchange of 3 amity earned per 3 energy consumed, but it never fails.

Additionally, it does not require having conversation topics prepared in advance.


◈ NPC Shops
Certain NPCs might offer items for sale only to those Adventurers they deeply trust. This means you need to raise your amity with them until you meet the amity points required for the purchase.

Items that require amity are difficult to obtain, and are usually sold at a lower price compared to obtaining them from the Central Market. However, once you purchase the item, your amity with the NPC will be consumed. You need to remember that you have to keep increasing your amity with the NPC through conversation and greetings if you want to purchase more items like that from them.

Subtópico: NPC Shops
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
If you have the knowledge of an NPC, you can check their location, services, and opening times through the Find NPCs tool, which you can find to the left of the minimap (top right corner of the screen).
For example, in the image above we can see that Lorenzo Murray, Velia’s stable keeper, offers some items for sale only after you’ve reached certain amity points with him, that he also offers quests unlocked in the same way, and that he is available at his location all day.
The usual NPC shop window offers three tabs: purchase, sell, and buyback.

• Purchase: Items can be purchased by selecting the item and clicking the button ‘Buy’, or by right-clicking the item. Items that can be stacked can be purchased by clicking the button of ‘Buy Multiple’ after entering the desired quantity. • Sell: When you click the button ‘Sell’ after selecting an item, you will sell it unit by unit. If the item you select can stack and has more than one unit, click the button 'Sell all selected items' to sell all the units of the selected item.You can also right-click the items in the Sell tab or from inventory while you are in any of the windows to sell them.Keep in mind that merchant NPCs won’t buy all items a character can obtain; you cannot sell to them bound items, trade items, valuable equipment, and more. • Buyback: After you select an item, press the button 'Buyback' or right-click the item to buy back an item you have sold to the NPC. However, remember that the NPC will only sell it back to you at a profit, and thus you will be losing silver.
• General Goods Vendor: Mainly sells various potions and alchemy tools.

• Blacksmith & Armor Vendor: Sells armor items. This NPC usually provides repair and extraction services. You can repair the current durability of the items you are wearing so that you can keep on using them, and the NPC also provides maximum durability repair service; where you can restore the maximum durability decreased due to enhancement failure. Additionally, you can also repair the equipment used for mounts such as horses.Extraction is the function to get black stones and other items from equipment that has been enhanced or altered.

➤ You can read more about this in the [Extraction] page.

• Arms Dealer: Sells a variety of weapons. Depending on the NPC, can also offer the repair service.

• Innkeeper & Food Vendor: Sells a variety of seasonings and ingredients for cooking. • Work Supervisor: You can hire workers through consuming energy. You can also buy and sell workers at the Worker Exchange option with silver. Make sure to have enough lodging in the same town for the workers you want to hire, as otherwise you won’t be able to hire them.

➤ You can read more about this in the [Workers] page. • Material Vendor: Sells items necessary for activities related to life skills, such as gathering tools. • Stable Keeper: Sells various items for land mounts. You can also check in and manage your land mounts such as horses, wagons, and more.

• Wharf Manager: Sells various items related to sea mounts. You can also check in and manage your sea mounts such as fishing boats and ships.

➤ You can read more about these two types of NPC in the [Stable & Wharf] page. • Luxury Vendor: Sells clothes useful for life skill activities. • Furniture Dealer: Sells furniture that can be placed in your residences.

➤ You can read more about residences in the [Houses] page. • Jeweler: Sells magic crystals that can be used for equipment items through transfusion. • Fish Vendor:  Sells fishing-related items. • Bookseller: This NPC sells books that can be placed in your residences and knowledge entries.

• Trade Manager: Sells and buys items related to the trading life skill, such as trade goods and items considered trade items, such as fish.

➤ You can read more about this in the [Trading] page.

• Old Moon Manager: This NPC sells a myriad of items related to various activities and content features of the game.

• Black Market: This NPC, Patrigio, is a special merchant available only at night. The selling price of the items it offers in his secret shop is not constant, and you do not know which item they will offer to sell you, but they sometimes sell rare or useful items.Do keep in mind that you need to spend energy every time you want to check a new item, and that the price they ask for the item might be above what one can pay for it in the Central Market.

If all your energy is restored, visit Patrigio at night. You may have a chance to buy items that you cannot easily find anywhere else!



Above you can see the hidden location of Patrigio in every city. You can visit him during the day, but keep in mind he will only offer his wares at night.

There are many other types of vendors found throughout Black Desert’s world, but you might need to travel to specific towns and locations to find them. These include herb vendors, seed vendors, fruit vendors, and more.

Subtópico: NPC Exchange
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
There is an immense amount of items in Black Desert, of which many are obtained from defeating monsters.

These are often referred to as ‘trash loot’ by Adventurers. While a great deal of these items are better sold in the Central Market, and others can only be sold to an NPC shop for silver,  some can be exchanged with other items for a bigger profit than what you would get by simply selling them for silver. In order to carry out an exchange like this, you need to collect a certain amount of the item in question and take them to the designated NPC. The NPC will then offer to exchange the looted items for a fixed item of appropriate value.

You can check which items you’ve obtained from defeating monsters are exchangeable through their tooltip.



The item above is named ‘Useful Coin Pouch’. When you take a look at its tooltip, you can see it can be exchanged at Tarif. It also says that you will need x150 of this item to exchange it for an Offensive Sub-weapon Box, or x600 if you want to exchange it for a Gold Bar 100G. If you collect x600 of this item and sell it to an NPC shop, you’ll get 468,000 silver. If, instead, you exchange the x600 units of this item to the designated NPC in Tarif, you’ll receive a Gold Bar 100G, which is valued at 1,000,000 silver. You’ll get more than double the amount of silver!

For these types of items, right-click the item in the inventory to take a look at the NPC Location and the Item Count options.The NPC Location button is a navigation function that shows you the way towards the NPC you have to meet to make the exchange, and the Item Count button shows the number of items you’ve collected. This way, you can see and keep track of the number of items when you’re in the field defeating monsters.




If you select Item Count, the item icon and number show up next to the minimap. If you want to move it, hold-click the icon and move it to your desired position.

Note that this option can also be used with other items that do not offer an exchange at an NPC, and helps you keep track of their number.

All NPCs that can have an item exchanged for another will have an Exchange option in their interface. This way you can check what items to keep an eye out for even if you have none yet.


When exchanging items, the number of items you possess will also appear in the exchange window, to the right of the item’s name.



If you make good use of this feature, you’ll be able to obtain bigger profits during your journey throughout Black Desert’s world.​​​​​​​

Stables and wharfs are where you can check in and manage your mounts.

Stables handle land mounts, such as horses, elephants, camels and wagons; you can manage them through the stable keeper NPCs located in every town and city, and even in some crossroads.

Wharfs handle ocean mounts, such as ships; you can manage them through wharf keeper NPCs located in towns, cities, and other piers at a river, the coast, or an island.





◈ Stable Interface
The stable is where you can view the information and statistics of the different mounts you possess and have stored in the different stables all around the world. You can access it from the main menu (hotkey: Esc) → Life (F6) → Stable, from the different stable keepers all throughout the world, and from the world map (hotkey: M).

By default, you can check in 3 mounts in a stable, and this number can be increased with a Stable Expansion Coupons. These coupons are obtained most often in the Pearl Shop by purchasing them with pearls and loyalties, and might be obtained during events as rewards and coupon gifts.


The detailed information of the selected mount will be displayed in the information window on the right-side of the mount selection screen.


◈ Manage Mount Skills



Train: Select one of the mount’s learned skills to train the skill for it to be mastered. Mount Skill Training Coupon must be used.
Delete: Deletes a mount’s learned skill.
Train All: Trains all skills of a mount to have them mastered. Train All requires a Mount All Skill Training Coupon.


◈ Connect Wagon
You can connect wagons and horses together with this option.However, in order to do this, both the wagon and all the horses must be checked in to the same stable.

When you connect a horse to a wagon, you can see the horse’s appearance as is, and connected horses will gain experience when traveling as a wagon.

For Adventurers who enjoy training horses, you can train many horses at once by attaching them to wagons.



In the image above you can see the Connect Wagon window showing a wagon and two horses. One of the horses is connected to the wagon, as seen by the chain icon and the 1/4 seen in the wagon.

Different wagons have a different amount of horses that can be connected to them.Keep in mind that wagons count as a mount in the stable, and as such, if you wish for example to connect 4 horses to a noble wagon, you will need 5 available slot spaces in the stable.


◈ Exchange Horse
This function lets you exchange a male and a female horse checked in at the stable for a new horse. Be warned that the selected horses will disappear, as this isn’t breeding.

In addition, since you cannot know what tier the obtained horse will be, you should exchange horses only after using up their breeding count.




◈ Breeding Market
This is where you can view the list of male horses registered for breeding.





◈ Horse Market





◈ Rental Market
Lets you view the list of horses that other Adventurers have rented out.

After making a deposit, you can get a rental horse. While renting, the Adventurer can forcibly withdraw the horse, or this one will be automatically withdrawn after 7 days. You can see your returned horse list and click Collect Rent to get some of the original deposit returned.







◈ Wharf Interface


Keep in mind that, if you have negative naval fame and are thus considered a pirate, you cannot use most wharfs around the continent. If that’s the case, you will still be able to employ the services of the wharf at the pirate haven of the Kuit Islands, home of the Cox Pirates.

You can defeat sea monsters and do a repeatable quest to regain naval fame points.

Subtópico: Maids & Butlers
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
While there might be Adventurers who’ve never seen a maid or butler, there are definitely zero Adventurers who’ve met one and not found them helpful. They will offer you their loyal services to move items between your character, town storages, and the Central Market.

Now then, let’s find out more about them.





Once you press the icon, the Maid/Butler List will open. Here you'll be able to see the list of all your maids and butlers, the number of them that are available for use, the buttons to use one type or another, and the command to use them in a group.


There are two types of maids and butlers; one type is dedicated to helping you manage your Central Market warehouse, and the other type is dedicated to helping you manage your town storages and your characters’ inventory items.

Type
Role
Weight Limit
Transaction
Can move silver or one item in your inventory to your Central Market warehouse and vice versa.
100VT
Storage
Can move silver or item(s) in your inventory to your town storage and vice versa.Can move non-character-bound items from the inventory of other characters in your family to the inventory of the character you’re currently playing.
100LT

Maids and butlers have a cooldown time of 20 minutes after being used, and of course, each one has its own respective cooldown timer.

Additionally, transaction maids/butlers can move up to 100VT of one item at a time, while storage maids/butlers can move up to 100LT of one item at a time.

Storage maids/butlers utilize the town storage of your character’s current location; for example, if you are in Valencia, you won’t be able to use Sand Grain Bazaar’s storage, but you will be able to use the Valencia City storage.

If you’ve completed the main questline of the Magnus and unlocked all territories, you are able to move items from your character’s inventory to any town’s storage you’ve discovered, except for the bandit haven of Muiquun.The 100LT limit still applies when using a storage maid/butler to move items to other storages aside from the local one.



Remember that you cannot store/remove trade/bartering goods and certain treasure items via this function.
You can conveniently transfer items between the characters of your family using maids/butlers.This is done via the End Game window, accessed from the main menu (hotkey: Esc) → Settings → Disconnect.

Once there, press the “View Character’s Inventory” icon in the bottom left part of any of your characters, to the left of the Change button.When the View Inventory window opens, you can right-click any non-character-bound item from the inventory and pearl inventory of any of the characters in your family to move it to the inventory of the character you’re currently playing.



Please note that normal maid/butler restrictions, such as the number of items and the 100LT weight limit, still apply. The same applies to trade goods, guild items, character-bound items, and certain treasure items.


The Find My Item window displays both the number of storage and transaction maids/butlers you have available for use at the moment.

For more information on how the inventory works, please check the [Inventory] page.


You can obtain one maid and one butler by completing Black Spirit quests.

Upon reaching level 51, you can get one of either a transaction butler or storage butler by completing the Black Spirit's Special Gift (Butler) quest under the Black Spirit Main Quest tab.




Just like with the butler, upon reaching Lv. 52, you can get a maid from the Black Spirit's Special Gift (Maid) quest. Once you complete the quest, you can select either a transaction or storage maid.




Right-click the maid / butler you obtained in your inventory (hotkey: I) to register and use them. The maids / butlers you have are shared between all characters within your family.

Subtópico: Campsite
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
Are you worn out from wandering through the wilderness without a place to stop for a moment?If that’s the case, get a campsite to have a cozy place to rest, anywhere you go.

The campsite can be set up in any location and can be used to repair equipment, access a shop, and others.

You’ll be able to increase your efficiency while defeating monsters by repairing equipment, buying potions, and helpful buffs right where you are. This’ll save you time since you won’t need to leave your spot to find NPCs in town for each of those.




The main way to get a camping tool is by completing a specific questline that will introduce you to this feature.You can get the quest Survival Guru from the Black Spirit once your character is Lv. 50 or above.

This once per family questline will reward you with the camping tool, an Old Moon camping tent, an Old Moon camping anvil, and an Old Moon camping shop.


You can use the camping tool permanently once you register it.The camping tent can be dyed and used permanently as well.

However, the camping anvil and camping shop can only be used for a limited time. A day for the anvil, and a week for the shop.

If you lose these items, or they expire, do not worry; they can be obtained again.You can get a new camping tool and Old Moon camping tent by talking with Jensen in Behr and purchasing new ones. A new camping tool will cost you a Gold Bar 100G, while a new camping tent a Gold Bar 10G.

You can get a new camping shop by purchasing one from any Old Moon Manager NPC in any main city, such as Heidel or Altinova, and a new camping anvil by crafting it yourself at an Old Moon Workshop in any town with one. For example, in the town of sorcery, Tarif, in the residence 2-2, 1F. Another way to make a new anvil is through processing (hotkey: L) – Manufacture.

Old Moon camping containers allow you to use the storage function.You can buy the containers from Old Moon Manager NPCs, and they can be used for 1 week after they’ve been opened. You can still get the items out of the container even if the 1 week period is over, but you won’t be able to put in new items.



Both methods require mostly the same materials. However, processing it yourself requires more materials to make the anvil than having it crafted at a workshop. So, if you want to mass produce them, then you should consider investing contribution points and making them through a workshop.

Old Moon anticorrosive can be bought from any Old Moon Manager NPC for 100,000 silver each.

You will get the Sealed Old Moon Camping Anvil when it’s made.The anvil won’t expire as long as you don’t right-click on it.

Once you open the sealed anvil, you can install and use it for 24 hours.


➤ You can read more about this in the [Workers] and [Houses] pages.

Old Moon managers also sell you the Old Moon camping shop contract. You can install the shop after right-clicking on the contract. You can use the shop for 7 days. The timer starts once you install the shop for the first time.




Location of the Old Moon managers in the first five cities Adventurers visit.



◈ How to Set up the Campsite
All characters in your family can set up the campsite once it’s registered.

You need to register the camping tool to set up the campsite. It can be registered by right-clicking on it.



To set up a campsite, left click on the campsite icon and it will appear on the spot you're standing on.



A campsite cannot be set up in safe zones, on top of roads, in areas with obstacles, steep slopes, or too small for it.Additionally, they cannot be set up during a Node/Conquest War. All campsites set up before the start of  a Node/Conquest War will automatically be removed.

The campsite doesn’t have a function on its own.If you set up a campsite without the tent and other items, then you’ll only get a bonfire.If you use a camping tent the bonfire will be replaced by a comfy-looking tent.If you place an anvil and shop in it, then you can repair equipment and buy items at your campsite.

You can place the Old Moon anvil and shop in your Campsite by pressing the R key near the campsite or clicking on the Campsite icon below your health bar, then right-clicking on the Old Moon anvil and shop in your inventory. Once they appear on your campsite, you can use the repair and shop functions.



The anvil works the same way as getting repairs from blacksmith NPCs. You must have the silver needed to pay for the repairs in your inventory.

The camping shop sells potions, and lets you exchange silver in your inventory for gold bars using the currency exchange function.It also sells buffs that can help you defeat monsters and survive in the desert. You can only use one of these buffs at a time.You cannot sell items bought from this shop except for the gold bars.

A camping container allows you to access some of the storage functions.It has 16 slots with a 200 LT weight limit for you to store items in, but it cannot store silver.You can store items that are not bound to you, but you cannot transport from here.Also note that, if Character A stores items in it, Character B cannot take them out.

If you’re using the Naphart campsite appearance from the Pearl Shop, further uses are enabled, such as purchasing villa buffs in it if you own a villa invitation.

Subtópico: Dye
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
You can find them in the Beauty tab of the Pearl Shop.

These boxes do not give you a specific dye, but randomly give you a dye from the category of the bundle. For the probabilities to obtain a desired specific dye from the boxes, please check the [Dye Boxes] page.
The Dye Palette window can be accessed by clicking on the Dyes button in your inventory (hotkey: I). This is where new dyes can be stored for use. Right-click a dye in your inventory to store it in the palette.Dye can be removed from the palette by selecting the dye and clicking the Take Out button.The palette can be used to view all available dyes and dyes that have been stored. Storing the dyes you possess here helps free up space in your pearl inventory.
Keep in mind that the use of Merv’s Palette grants access to all dyes for as long as it is active, which allows one to dye equipment without the need to use the obtained dyes.The effects of Merv’s Palette disappear once the function is no longer active. However, the dyes applied to equipment pieces when it was active are saved internally. This means that if you activate Merv’s Palette, dye an item, and then the Merv’s Palette runs out, the dye will disappear, but upon reactivating Merv’s Palette the dye you previously applied to the item will reappear. You can use the palette to see all the dyes’ names and the color they apply when used.
Dye can be used to change the color of equipment anywhere and anytime, if you have the dye in your palette.


Equipment dyed using the same color may look different due to varying textures of the equipment piece or the source type of the dye.

Each equipment piece will have a different number of parts available to be dyed.

You’ll be able to see what your equipment will look like with the selected dyes before applying them with the preview to the right. If you want to change the color or the part the color is applied to, just click the [x] above the selected color on the Select Equipment Part to cancel it.
By combining two dyes you can get an Unknown Dye Box. When you open the Unknown Dye Box, you’ll get a new random dye.


Access the window from the menu.

Subtópico: Desert
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
For the most part, this desert is a sandy, desolate land where the scorching sun during the day and the bitter cold at night make it easy for Adventurers to get ill.

In desert areas, the movement speed of mounts such as horses and wagons is reduced, and you will notice that finding your way with the World Map (hotkey: M) and minimap becomes increasingly difficult.

Additionally, sandstorms may suddenly blow your way, posing a serious threat to an Adventurer’s life if they’re unprepared. Due to this, it is necessary to be aware of all the particularities of these regions and prepare accordingly before setting out.

Despite these dangers, many Adventurers frequent the territory because the desert is packed with riches and challenges made more easily accessible thanks to the different features available, such as camels and elephants adapted to the terrain.


During the day the hot temperature can cause your character to get the heatstroke debuff, which will slowly but surely deplete their health until a cure is applied.

When you get ill in the desert due to either heatstroke or hypothermia, you can always restore your health with potions and other methods until the debuff eventually disappears, but it is highly recommended to instead use an item specifically made to cure them to have a smoother journey.


- Star Anise TeaThis beverage will cure the hypothermia your character might suffer from at night.You can obtain it by processing (hotkey: L) star anise, acquired by gathering star anise trees, together with purified or distilled water via simple cooking.
- Purified WaterPurified water will cure the heatstroke your character might suffer from during the day.You can obtain it by gathering river or muddy water with an empty bottle and processing it via the filtering option (hotkey: L).



When you travel across the desert, it is recommended to have both purified water and star anise tea in your inventory.

Alternatively, if you find yourself suffering from either heatstroke or hypothermia in the middle of the desert and do not have any purified water or star anise tea to cure yourself, seek Ibellab Oasis. If you approach the bonfire there it will cure hypothermia, and if you get into the water it will cure heatstroke.


The other environmental danger of the desert is sandstorms. They will cause great damage to Adventurers caught within them.If you become aware of an approaching sandstorm, the best thing to do is avoid it by running away. If you’ve already been caught by one, you can set up a tent and hide in it until the sandstorm disappears or moves on from your location.

Desert tent tools can be purchased from Stable Keeper NPCs in the territories of Mediah and Valencia, and can be quickly set up by right-clicking on them. They can only be used within the desert.




Scattered throughout the Great Desert you will find ancient devices; columns surrounding what appears to be an unstable portal at the center. Crossing them will teleport you to either the Aakman Temple or the Hystria Ruins, the two most dangerous, dungeon-like underground monster zones in all of Valencia.

The ancient teleporters lead to one or the other at seemingly random. You must be wondering how can you choose to go to one of the two locations, and not end up on the other by chance.A renowned alchemist in Valencia, Karashu, came up with the method to easily identify which of the portals lead to the Hystria Ruins.To unlock this ability, you must go visit him, Karashu, in Sand Grain Bazaar, and do a couple of quests, starting with Forgotten Core Part. These family quests are available once you’ve completed the main questline for Mediah, or reached chapter 9 of Fughar’s memorandum if you have a season character.

Once you have completed these quests, you will be able to differentiate the portals leading to Hystria Ruins (right) thanks to the light surrounding them!


As you traverse the Great Desert of Valencia, you may find yourself in front of a couple of huge figures wandering the dunes. During daytime, you can face off against Kreator, while during nighttime, against Laytenn.

Keator is a member of the Aakman tribe that has turned their back on the traditional views of the group, and like those trapped in the Aakman Temple, is using the wisdom of the ancients and the black energy to gain power and take their revenge against the Kingdom of Valencia.When fighting Kreator, be aware that when its HP is low enough it will summon the ancient weapons Alten and Kalten to assist them.

Laytenn is a mysterious ancient weapon aimlessly roaming the desert, some say in search of something. If you have previously encountered Kreator, do not underestimate Laytenn by believing it on the same level. Like many other monsters in Black Desert’s world are empowered during nighttime, Laytenn, a monster that only appears during this time, is naturally way more powerful than Kreator. Watch out for its axe attacks imbued with lightning, and the movement debuffs that come from being hit by them!Those who defeat Laytenn have a chance to obtain Laytenn's Power Stone, a popular yellow-grade accessory that offers the same statistics as the even more popular Ogre Ring.



Subtópico: The Great Expedition
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
This page is centered around the various features available with The Great Expedition. For the basics on sailing and bartering, necessary to enjoy the activities described here, please check the [Sailing & Bartering] page.

Many sailors have gathered at the taverns and inns of Velia and Port Epheria to find a captain who would sail to the broad ocean, as rumors circulate of a renewed interest in what the Great Ocean can offer.Islands in the ocean are full of papu and otter barterers who are competing with each other to barter with Adventurers.People who have tried to cross the ocean are now drifting in Margoria, and each of them has their own reasons to be in such a situation.Meanwhile, a strange current coming from the mysterious island of Oquilla's Eye has caused bizarre sea creatures to drift to the innermost parts of the seas of Calpheon and Balenos, threatening the people living there.

The Great Expedition adds several maritime features to content available in the Great Ocean. Upgrade your ship or build a new one, hire your crew, and go barter and fight monsters on the huge and vast ocean.Follow Jarette Domongatt's request and unravel the mysteries behind Oquilla's Eye and the Vell Pirates. Gather your guild and dare confront Khan, Eye of the Ocean.Discover the secrets behind the fog-ridden never before seen island of Crow’s Nest from where the First Crow operates.From the docks of Grándiha, off the coast of Kamasylvia, follow the Lamute Gang into the eternal war in the island of otters and papus, Papua Crinea.These adventures, and more, await you.






Tranan Underfoe, the blacksmith of Velia, has a strange tale for you of an island somewhere in the Great Ocean. Many brave sailors have searched for the Crow's Nest, yet failed to return. That is if they were lucky enough to return at all. Now, you have a chance to search for this misty island shrouded in mystery on your own. Chase after that tale and you will get to meet the owner and founder of the Crow Merchants Guild, the First Crow, and gaze upon a display of some of his most valued treasures in the Hall of Heroes. You will also be able to participate in the Pit of the Undying, a battle arena steeped in secrets.

Why did the “natives” of Oquilla’s Eye hoard crow coins? What is the purpose behind the secretive headquarters of the Crow Merchants Guild? And what is really the Pit of the Undying?

The quest [Crow's Nest] A Strange Tale from the Great Ocean, given by the Black Spirit once you’ve above Lv. 56, will begin the [The Great Expedition] Crow’s Nest, Misty Island of Mystery questline.

Finishing the questline will grant you access to the Pit of the Undying, a PvE a 1 vs 1 fighting arena.


Once you complete the [Papua Crinea] An Amazing Gift Just for You quest, the Lamute Gang's Adventure Journal, consisting 5 parts, will be unlocked.This adventure log is divided into Grándiha, Papu, and Otter chapters. As you complete the chapters in order, you will be rewarded transformation scrolls for either papus or otters.

During the completion of the first questline, [The Great Expedition] Finding Papua Crinea of the Thousand Year War, you will need to complete the first book of the Lamute Gang’s Adventure Journal. Unless it is completed, you won’t be able to progress with the questline, or unlock the other two.
Once you’ve reached Papua Crinea through the quests, you will soon realize you must transform into either an otter or papu to interact, obtain knowledge, and do quests there. If not, you won’t be able to even talk to them.

Progressing through the Papua Crinea questlines will reward you with a 1 day use transformation scroll.
The papus and otters of Papua Crinea have been fighting each other for generations in the Thousand Year War.

Once you arrive at the island, you will be able to take a side.If you choose to fight for the papus, you will be able to befriend Empress Papuraora, but will alienate the otters. Conversely, if you choose to fight for the otters, you will get close to General Crioniak, but get on bad terms with the papus.If your amity with Empress Papuraora or General Crioniak falls below -2500, you will not be able to talk with papus or otters (depending on which authority figure you are on bad terms with), even if you are transformed into one of them. For example, if you have low amity with Empress Papuraora, even if you are transformed into a papu you won't be able to converse with other papus.

Unlike the papus and otters you may have encountered throughout the continent, those on Papua Crinea were so isolated from the mainland that they do not know how to communicate with you in your language, so you will need to transform into one of them to interact with both sides.

You can receive the [For the Thousand Year War] Stoneback Crab Training questline from Benns Moanna (Papu) or Benns Morio (Otter) at Bloodshed Beach for 5 days (1 quest per day) as you progress through the Papua Crinea quests.

These quests consist of the following:


Daily quests can be found on several islands, such as Oquilla's Eye and Iliya Island. They're a good source for Sailing EXP and ship upgrade materials.

The following quests can be obtained from Oquilla's Eye and Iliya Island. They task you with engaging in bartering, gathering, and sea monster hunting. Most of them reward you with ship upgrade materials for caravels, galleasses, and carracks.


The quests available at the Dancing Marlin Tavern, in Velia, focus on bartering and sea monster hunting on an easier level, and reward you with sailing EXP.


Please note that the daily quests offered at the Dancing Marlin Tavern require a sailing life skill level of beginner 2.




All the above quests will reward you with a letter called Ravinia's Wiggly-Waggly Letter. Open this special letter to randomly accept an interesting quest from Ravinia. These quests will ask you to perform a variety of activities, such as bartering, meeting relevant characters, performing sea monster hunting, and more.

Complete the given quests and receive different rewards which will help you in upgrading a sailboat or frigate into a caravel or galleass, in addition to a large amount of sailing EXP and crow coins.

Crow’s Nest, as mentioned above, is the island covered in fog managed by the Crow Merchants Guild, located north of Tinberra Island. Many at sea, both wealthy and unfortunate alike, search for its location for one or another reason.

There, you can purchase items such as Khan's Concentrated Magic and other ocean-related goods such as equipment for a carrack, ship upgrade materials, or ship equipment enhancement materials.

Please note that for most of the items offered by Ravinia to be purchased with crow coins, their cost in crow coins is a lot higher than it is to obtain the item directly by yourself. As such, it is better to purchase items from Ravinia only when you need a few of a single type, in case of needing ship upgrade materials for example. Other items you will require, however, will need to be purchased from Ravinia. It is recommended to save your crow coins for when you’re at that point in time.

You can purchase the following items from Rebinia's shop. Remember that you can only purchase the special, limited boxes containing the items below from Rebinia on Lema Island.




The Great Expedition has opened many possibilities. Among them, Port Epheria has allowed for the crafting of advanced types of ship equipment parts in their ship part workshops. From small transport vessels such as the cog, to long & arduous projects such as upgrading a sailboat or frigate into their improved versions, and / or upgrade those or the base ones into a caravel or galleass, then upgrade those into one of the four types of carrack. A lot of upgrading!

These ships are accompanied by their respective green grade and blue grade ship equipment pieces, which are obtained via traditional shops, Ravinia’s crow coin shop, and crafting.

Ships in the world of Black Desert are differentiated into small and large.

- Small ships include: rowboats, fishing boats, and Epheria cogs (Epheria Cog: Kalis-Certified & Epheria Cog: Fallen Vell Pirates' Legacy).- Large ships include: Guild galleys, Bartali sailboats, Epheria sailboats, Epheria frigates, Epheria caravels, Epheria galleasses, and Epheria carracks (Advance, Balance, Volante, and Valor).

This section will only tackle the Epheria cog and the awarded Epheria galleon. For information regarding how to obtain and upgrade all large ships starting with the Bartali sailboat, please check the [Ship Upgrading] page. Likewise, for information on the guild galley, please check the [Guild Mounts] page.
Its default sailing speed is high, but its durability is low, making it vulnerable to the sea monsters' attacks. Commonly used to travel between the islands near the mainland, it is not recommended to use it to sail the high seas beyond the Ross Sea.

It can use the Breezy Sail skill by default, which will help you reach your objective quickly, and more importantly, battle going against strong currents and wind.

When its lifespan ends, its sailing speed will decrease significantly and you won't be able to use the ship.

You can build the Epheria Cog in one of the following two ways. The first one is crafted with materials obtained in the mainland, while the second one is crafted with materials obtained with activities related to The Great Expedition.
The Epheria galleon is one of the greatest ships the world of Black Desert has ever seen.

It can be obtained in two ways:
– When a special barter appears during barter, there is a low chance for the item “Epheria's Star” to be obtainable.
– The guild victorious in a conquest war in the territories of Calpheon, Mediah, and Valencia is rewarded the item “Epheria’s Star.”

Please note you will find it in the guild’s storage. Only the guild master can move Epheria's star from the guild storage, and award a deserving guild member via the Present button found at the bottom of the guild’s storage window.



With this item in your inventory, you can accept a special quest from Philaberto Falasi in Port Epheria. Complete this quest to obtain the ship license for an Epheria galleon, and the Captain Epheria title, which is a temporary title that lasts for 7 days.

➤ For more information about this ship, please check the [Sailing & Bartering] page.

The necessary materials to upgrade the equipment pieces for green grade old ship equipment can be forcefully enhanced from any enhancement level.These equipment pieces use verdant black stones to be enhanced, and these can be obtained by exchanging Lv. 1 barter trade goods with any of Ravinia's sisters.

Ravinia and her sisters are located in the following locations:

- Crow's Nest - Ravinia- Iliya Island - Revinia- Epheria - Ruvinia- Velia - Rovinia
You can purchase green grade equipment for Epheria caravel and Epheria galleass from Philaberto Falasi in Port Epheria.

You can enhance these ship equipment pieces with the following black stones available via bartering or the crow coin shop.

- Fiery Black Stone, for level 0-5 enhancement.- Frosted Black Stone, for level 6-10 enhancement.
Green grade equipment for the Epheria carracks can be bought in the crow coin shop via Ravinia or Rebinia. They're named:

- Epheria Carrack: Toro Sail- Epheria Carrack: Toro Prow- Epheria Carrack: Toro Cannon- Epheria Carrack: Toro Plating

This equipment is enhanced with Solar Black Stones (until enhancement level +4) and Lunar Black Stones (from enhancement level +4 to +10).

- Use Heating in the Processing window on Fiery Black Stone x10 and Starlight Crystal x1 to get Solar Black Stone x1.- Use Heating in the Processing window on Frosted Black Stone x10 and Starlight Crystal x1 to get Lunar Black Stone x1.

You can purchase Starlight Crystal from NPC Ravinia's crow coin shop.
Blue grade equipment for the carracks can be crafted at Chiro's ship part workshop located at the house at Iliya Island 3.At this workshop you can craft the 16 blue grade Epheria carrack ship parts, as well as the sunset black stone which is needed to enhance them.

Please note that the type of ship parts must match the type of Epheria carrack you own.

For a more detailed account on the different types of ship equipment pieces for all these types of ships and how to obtain them, please check the Ship Upgrading page linked above.

In addition to being central to the storyline presented in The Great Expedition, a strange natural phenomenon occurs at Oquilla's Eye every 3 hours. Many say they witnessed a waterspout rising from the center of Oquilla's Eye, but no one knows why this happens. You could get seriously injured if you're in the water when this happens, due to the power of the rising water. This phenomenon at the center of Oquilla's Eye also spews up lost treasures from the depths of the ocean, so watch out for chests falling from the sky.

A system message will be displayed every 3 hours while you’re on the island. After a while, a waterspout will rise from the center of Oquilla's Eye. If your character is at this location when this happens, your character could die. There are no death penalties for dying from the waterspout.

A fearsome guild boss, said to be related to the world boss Vell, is rumored to appear in the center of Oquilla's Eye. Some say its concentrated magic can be employed by skilled alchemists to craft powerful alchemy stones that are useful both in combat and outside of it.

➤ Please read more about it in the [Guild Boss] page.

Due to the waves from Oquilla's Eye, large numbers of sea monsters have been spotted moving into the coastal seas. Don't worry too much, though, as they’re as startled as you to find themselves there, and as such do not initiate combat on their own.

You can find hungry hekarus and ocean stalkers dwelling along the coasts of islands, young hekarus and young ocean stalkers roaming the areas south of Padix Island and the wide northern area of Lema Island, and hekarus and ocean stalkers lurking in the areas of the Ross Sea and Margoria.

Once you go beyond Margoria, you will start to encounter ninesharks, candidums, and black rusts. These are more stronger than the previously mentioned, and you will need to build stronger ships to confront them. It is recommended to not engage in battle against these monsters unless you possess a caravel or galleass.

Remember that defeating sea monsters gives you sailing and sailor EXP.

The Sea of Silence, pictured above, confuses even the most thorough investigator.With the strange events happening at the Al Halam Sea near Orisha Island, the people of Altinova now refer to the area as the "Sea of Silence." It is an area where sea currents and wind have died, and survivors of vessels that have crossed it speak of hostile, derelict ships appearing out of nowhere.

There's a high chance of phantom ships appearing here. You will receive rewards you can sell to merchants in towns when you defeat them.

Cox Pirates' Shadow Ghost is an encounter you can come across in various areas of the coastal seas, and has a low chance to drop summon scroll pieces.Combine 5 of these scroll pieces to craft a summon scroll to make the Cox Pirates' Ghost appear.

The reward for facing and defeating the Cox Pirates’ Ghost is a choice between the different types of Cox Pirates’ artifacts (parley beginner, parley expert, or combat).

As mentioned in the questlines section above, transformation scrolls are necessary to survive in Papua Crinea.Papus and otters are at war with each other, so they do not trust outsiders. They will only speak in their own languages if you approach them without transforming.

Now, here’s how to use these transformation scrolls.



◈ Lamute Gang’s Darkcloud Shapeshifting Dictionary
You can transform into the following otters and papus with the help of the Darkcloud Shapeshifting Dictionary from the Lamute Gang.

Papu
Otter
Panipani Villager
Queekity Thumpity Moon Villager
Brave Pine Blader
Gallant Conch Blader
Immortal Persimmon Knight
Undefeated Crab Knight
Holy Date Priest
Holy Sea Cucumber Priest
Dreamy Bubble Shaman
Ruinous Puffer Shaman
Frosty Chestnut Slinger
Fierce Lobster Boxer


1. Right clicking on a transformation scroll will show you a spot where you can transform with a pillar of light.
2. Use the scroll and press R to transform into the summoned otter or papu.
3. Going to the papu island as an otter or vice versa will result in you being attacked by guards and transformation will be lifted.
4. Some actions, such as summoning the Black Spirit or fishing, will be limited while you are transformed.
Limitations are similar to those when you are riding a horse.
As in, you cannot fish or call the Black Spirit while on a horse, but you can talk to NPCs.
So, if you need to talk to the Black Spirit, press Shift + R to end transformation.

On Papua Crinea, you will encounter rare creatures which are hardly found on the main continent, and difficult to discern.

- Lazy Rock Spirit- Lazy Cloudy Rain Mushroom

These two monsters don't attack you first, and are well disguised, which makes it hard to find them. You cannot attack them with a normal character. Only a papu or an otter will be able to.


Lamute Gang's Benns Coin
Can be obtained with Grándiha's daily quests. Lamute Gang's Benns Coin x1 can be exchanged for Rainbow Petal Coin x1 or Rainbow Fish Bone Coin x1 from Benns Lamute.

Rainbow Petal Coin
Coins used as currency by the papus and the otters. Can be obtained by completing the Papuraora Island and Crioniak Island quests.

Rainbow Fish Bone Coin
There are 3 types of coins available related to Papua Crinea.You can obtain the following with Rainbow Petal Coins or Rainbow Fish Bone Coins.

Items You Can Exchange Rainbow Petal Coins for:
- Papu's Beloved Flower, from Chief Benitu of the Panipani Village.- Holy Date Priest Transformation Scroll (Permanent) and Dreamy Bubble Shaman Transformation Scroll (Permanent) from Benns Moanna of the Lamute Gang.

Items You Can Exchange Rainbow Fish Bone Coins for:

Ship Upgrades
You can follow the upgrade chart below to build your ship up to an Epheria carrack.

Steps for Upgrading to Epheria Carracks


The basic starter ship for most Adventurers is the Bartali sailboat. However, you can opt to purchase an Epheria sailboat or frigate license from the Central Market to skip this step.

As you can see above, you will need to pick between an Epheria sailboat or frigate early on, as it will give you different options of Epheria carracks you can ultimately upgrade your ship to, depending on their use.


Bartali Sailboat


The Bartali sailboat is the most basic of the large ships you can get. It can be purchased from Proix, the owner of the Dancing Marlin Tavern in Velia, for 10,000,000 silver.

You can also obtain one as a quest reward through the questline [The Great Expedition] First Sailboat into Oquilla’s Eye, which begins with the quest Vigorous Velia, with a Lv. 50 or higher character while in the territory of Balenos. The actual quest that gives the ship as a reward is called Jarette's Support.

It is also recommended to do this questline due to the sailor’s oath it gives as rewards. These items, when used, permanently expand your max sailor slots. These become important down the line as you progress in your effort to obtain better ships.



Remember, you can purchase the ship licenses for Epheria sailboats and frigates from the Central Market, if you can afford it, to skip this part of the process.



The Epheria sailboat (left) and Epheria frigate (right) are on the second stage of the carrack upgrade path.As these two ships differ in which type of carracks they can ultimately upgrade to, they’re the point in which an important decision has to be made.

Epheria sailboats allow you to eventually make the Balance carrack or the Advance carrack. The Balance carrack has stats evenly distributed, while the Advance carrack is the ideal ship for bartering, as it can carry more weight.

Epheria frigates on the other hand allow you to make the Valor carrack or the Volante carrack. The Valor carrack is great for sea monster hunting and naval combat, while the Volante carrack is the fastest of all the carracks.

Do you ultimately want the best ship for naval combat, or the fastest one? Go for an Epheria frigate.Do you, instead, want the best ship for bartering, or a jack of all trades, master of none? Go for an Epheria sailboat.



Remember that ship licenses for Epheria sailboats and frigates can be purchased from the Central Market.

If you would like to make your own, follow the steps shown below.


◈ How to Upgrade
Register the ship you wish to upgrade at a wharf via the Wharf Manager NPC. Then use the Upgrade menu option and add all the materials required to upgrade the ship.

However, you cannot upgrade your ship under the following circumstances:- A piece of equipment is not at max durability.- The ship has equipment equipped or has items in its inventory.- A sailor is on board the ship.

The equipment required to upgrade the Bartali sailboat to an Epheria sailboat or Epheria frigate can be purchased from Philaberto Falasi in Port Epheria. You can then use black stone (armor) to enhance them. When you fail an enhancement attempt, the max durability of the equipment will decrease. You can purchase more of the same equipment and use the copies to repair the original’s max durability to full.



Alternatively, you can craft your own Epheria sailboat & frigate ship licenses in the town house of Port Epheria 3-5, 2nd floor, when employed as a shipyard. Obtaining them this way, most of the materials needed are halved in number.


◈ Improved Epheria Sailboat/Frigate
Additionally, sailboats and frigates can both be improved. Once they are improved, you can use the skills Volley and Focus Fire.Volley allows you to move the cannons on the left or right and fire them. Focus Fire allows you to fire multiple shots quickly at a location of your choice.

There are certain upgrade materials that can be obtained by defeating sea monsters. Defeating these enemies will also help you obtain materials for the next step of the upgrade path. Thus, having your ship improved will aid you in your endeavor to build a carrack.

As with the upgrade from a Bartali sailboat, you can improve your ships at any wharf manager.

However, keep in mind that improving your ship does not change the materials required to upgrade them to a caravel or galleass.

Epheria caravels (left) have 30 slots and can carry 10,000LT. This makes them great trading and bartering ships.On the other hand, the Epheria galleass (right) has 4 cannons on each side, for a total of 8 cannons, which makes them great for naval combat.

Both of them can be improved to use the sailing skill Volley while moving, or the  Focus Fire skill to fire multiple shots quickly at a location of your choice for massive damage.

Some of the upgrade materials for both types of ships are obtained by defeating sea monsters, while others require you to barter for them. Both methods, sea monster hunting and bartering, will broaden your knowledge of content available at sea. That’s why even if you only want a bartering ship you will need to defeat sea monsters, and why even if you only want a ship for naval combat you will need to barter a bit.

The materials required to upgrade your ship to a caravel or galleass are listed below.

The 4 pieces of equipment required to upgrade to an Epheria caravel or Epheria galleass can be purchased from Philaberto Falasi in Port Epheria. The equipment pieces can be enhanced using verdant black stones. When using these stones to enhance ship equipment, you have a 100% chance to succeed at all levels. You will need 55 verdant black stones to enhance a piece of equipment up to +10, and a total of 220 verdant black stones to enhance all four of them.

You can obtain verdant black stones as follows.

1. Ravinia’s sisters have anchored in Port Epheria (Ruvinia), Velia (Rovinia), and Iliya Island (Revinia). You can exchange Lv. 1 bartering trade goods through Ruvinia, Rovinia, and Revinia in exchange for Crow Merchants Guild's barter vouchers.

2. Bring the Crow Merchants Guild's barter vouchers obtained from one of the sisters to Ravinia at the Crow’s Nest to exchange them for verdant black stones. Rumor has it that Morco in Velia will also take these vouchers and exchange them for verdant black stones as well.

3. Alternatively, at a low rate, you can obtain these black stones from defeating the following sea monsters: Young Hekaru, Young Ocean Stalker, Hekaru, and Ocean Stalker.

◈ Crow’s Nest and Ravinia
You might not have heard of Crow’s Nest or Ravinia at this point in your adventure. Crow’s Nest is an island shrouded in fog, located north of Tinberra Island.

Once you arrive in Crow’s Nest, you can talk to the NPC Ravinia. She runs the crow coin shop that sells items needed to upgrade large ships. However, keep in mind that she asks for large sums of crow coins for any purchase, and thus it cannot be relied upon to obtain all the materials you require to upgrade your ships.



Crow’s Nest is the island covered in fog managed by the Crow Merchants Guild, located north of Tinberra Island. Many at sea, both wealthy and unfortunate alike, search for its location for one or another reason.

Ravinia also gives the Ravinia’s Ship Upgrade Log questline you will have seen mentioned above. You can complete these quests to get ship upgrading materials you need.

The first quest you get is called Ravinia’s Ship Upgrade Log I, and the last quest is Ravinia’s Ship Upgrade Log VII. It will take 7 days to accept these quests in order. When you complete each of these quests, Ravinia will reward you with Ravinia's Wiggly Waggly Letter. You use these letters to accept quests from Ravinia. The quests she gives provide upgrade materials required to upgrade caravels and galleasses.

Subtópico: Old Moon Grand Prix
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
The Old Moon Grand Prix requires a minimum of 5 Adventurers, referred to as riders, to begin, and races are held between 16:00 - 9:00 UTC for NA, and 8:00 - 1:00 UTC for EU. Each race allows up to a maximum of 10 Adventurers to register for participation.

Keep in mind that it does not open while node & conquest wars are in session, and it won’t let you enter it from 15 minutes before said wars start, up until they’ve finished.

Anyone can freely join the Old Moon Grand Prix by pressing the Race Info icon on the upper right-hand of your screen, to the left of the minimap, or from the (new) main menu (hotkey: Esc) → Life —> Old Moon Grand Prix.
To join the Old Moon Grand Prix, you will need to have registered your race horse at the stable keeper. You can retrieve your registered horse through Miles, the stable keeper within the racing track.

You can register up to 5 horses within the stable, and you will have 5 additional stable slots for registering racehorses only.

You can purchase a horse emblem for Giorgia Brisa, which is required to register race horses, from Gula, the Stable Keeper NPC at Stonetail Horse Ranch, or Miles, the stable keeper of the Old Moon Grand Prix.

As soon as the first participant / rider joins the Old Moon Grand Prix queue, a 3-minute timer will be set, which will see 3 additional minutes added per every additional participant.This timer will only continue adding minutes up until 5 riders have joined, and if at least 5 participants have not joined when the timer runs out, the race will be canceled and all riders in queue will exit.

If 5 or more participants have joined and the timer runs out, or if 10 have joined, then the queue timer will end, as 1 minute of prep time will be given before the race begins.

Subtópico: Treasures
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
Treasures in Black Desert are very difficult to acquire. However, their unique abilities make them very desirable for Adventurers who are looking for a challenge.

Treasures can be created by collecting the required materials in your inventory and rearranging them in the appropriate shape.The materials needed have an extremely low drop rate, and it may even take months to completely gather just one of the materials.Despite this, many Adventurers still seek them out throughout the world of Black Desert because of the treasures’ amazing abilities.

Why don’t we dive straight into these treasures and learn how to craft them?


It works in great combination with Fairy Laila’s “Miraculous Cheer” ability that automatically consumes potions.


◈ How to Create Ornette’s Spirit Essence



Ornette’s Spirit Essence recovers your HP, and requires five different materials to craft it.


Gather all the materials listed above and place them in your inventory in the appropriate shape seen below.



Arrange the materials in a [+] sign and press the + symbol to combine them and obtain Ornette’s Spirit Essence.


◈ How to Create Odore’s Spirit Essence



Odore’s Spirit Essence recovers your MP/WP/SP, and also requires five materials to craft it.


Gather all the materials listed above and place them in your inventory in the appropriate shape seen below.



Arrange the materials in a [+] sign and press the + symbol to combine them and obtain Odore’s Spirit Essence.

In the case you obtain an item called Atanis' Element, you can exchange it for the so-called pity pieces at Merindora, in Grána. Once you have obtained 100 pity pieces of a type, you can craft the full material item needed for a potion. For example, using simple alchemy on x100 Blood Wolf's Oath and x1 Crimson Breath of Resentment (given by Merindora as well), you’ll obtain x1 Ash Halfmoon Kagtunak.







◈ How to Create Lafi Bedmountain’s Upgraded Compass
You need a total of 6 different materials to create Lafi Bedmountain's Upgraded Compass. Upgraded Compass Parts are core materials that share the same appearance when first obtained, but their true shape can be revealed when they are identified by NPC Ain Greid at the node Ancient Fissure, in Mediah. The appearance of each Upgraded Compass Part depends on the monster that dropped it.

The Lafi Bedmountain’s Upgraded Compass requires all 3 different unique parts.

(Before Appraisal) Upgraded Compass Parts

(After Appraisal) Lafi Bedmountain’s Upgraded Compass Parts

3 gems are also required along with the Upgraded Compass Parts to craft the compass.


Once all the materials have been collected, arrange them in your inventory as you see below to combine the gems with the compass parts.



Arrange the items in that shape to obtain Lafi Bedmountain’s Upgraded Compass.(Materials can be combined without appraising the compass parts as long as the correct compass parts are in their proper slot.)



There is a Traveler’s Map in Black Desert that can teleport you to the nearest town.It can teleport you across far distances, but you need to be careful when you use it if you’re planning to return to your original position.

However, this treasure dubbed the Archaeologist's Map not only just teleports you to the nearest town, but also returns you to the position where you used it.



Like with Lafi Bedmountain’s Upgraded Compass, the Archaeologist’s Map will require you to obtain several parts and gems.


◈ How to Create Archaeologist's Map
You need 4 Archaeologist's Map Pieces and 4 gems to obtain the Archaeologist's Map. Archaeologist's Map Pieces are core materials that share the same appearance when first obtained, but their true shape can be revealed by interacting with the Caphras Journal inside Caphras Cave, in Calpheon.
(4 different unique pieces of the map are required to create the Archaeologist's Map.)

(Before Appraisal) Map of Unknown Piece

(After Appraisal) Archaeologist's Map Piece


You'll need to acquire 4 different kinds of gems along with the unique map pieces.




Arrange the materials in that shape to obtain the Archaeologist's Map.(Materials can be combined without appraising the compass parts as long as the correct compass parts are in their proper slot.)



Adventurers on their voyage to the waters are often surprised by how vast the ocean can be.Ebenruth's Nol is a helpful treasure that can be equipped on an Epheria Carrack or a Panokseon to help you sail across the ocean separating the known lands from the Land of the Morning Light.

Equipping Ebenruth's Nol will allow you to use the sea mount skill Breezy Sail once more without consuming any stamina, and increases its movement distance by 50%.




◈ How to Create Ebenruth’s Nol
Ebenruth’s Nol requires Symbol-Engraved Nol and Ebenruth.To obtain an Ebenruth, you need to obtain x1000 Oquilla's Flower and x1 Oquilla's Tear. To create a Symbol-Engraved Nol, you must defeat ocean monsters called saltwater crocodiles to acquire an item called Moss-Covered Map.

Use the processing method of simple alchemy on the Moss-Covered Map with NPC Ravinia's Moss Remover to obtain one of the nine different Torn Treasure Map Piece items.  Collect all nine map pieces and combine them to obtain the Treasure Map of a Sailor item. Rumors say there is also an extremely low chance to obtain this treasure map by using simple alchemy on a Torn Treasure Map Piece.



After acquiring the Treasure Map of a Sailor, proceed with a quest to obtain the Treasure Chest of a Sailor. Opening the box will give you a Symbol-Engraved Nol at a certain chance.

Ebenruth can be obtained by using simple alchemy on x1000 Oquilla's Flower and x1 Oquilla's Tear. Oquilla's Flower can be acquired through barter, purchased from a Crow’s Nest vendor, and from the Treasure Chest of a Sailor. Oquilla’s Tear can be acquired only through purchase from a Crow’s Nest vendor.





There are rumors that Adventurers are currently seeking the Rich Merchant’s Ring by using the hints from the image below.






◈ How to Obtain
While mounted on one of the three mythical horses, visit Merindora in Grána to accept the [Krogdalo's Sanctuary] questline. The quests will require you to possess the three mythical horses to complete them and receive the King of Celestial Horses’ sanctuary.

You can read more about mythical horses and this treasure on the [Mythical Horses] page.



When Ulukita, a region of ancient weapons, the power of darkness, and lawless people was revealed, Lafi Bedmountain decided to create a new invention using unique parts found only there.

This treasure can be said to be the opposite of Lafi Bedmountain’s Upgraded Compass. Instead of moving other Adventurers to your location, it moves you to their position.



◈ How to Create Lafi Bedmountain’s Upgraded Telescope
You need a total of 5 different materials to create Lafi Bedmountain's Upgraded Telescope:The Upgraded Telescope Parts (3 unique items), and 2 gemstones.

The Lafi Bedmountain’s Upgraded Telescope requires all 3 different unique parts.


As seen in the table above, it is said that somewhere in Ulukita, scholar Ulubala has already excavated one of the several types of parts Lafi Bedmountain is researching. They are conducting research on Lafi Bedmountain’s Upgraded Compass, and if given 3 units of a specific compass part shown below, they will exchange them for the telescope part they excavated.


Additionally, 2 gemstones are also required along with the Upgraded Telescope Parts to craft the treasure.Once all the materials have been collected, arrange them in your inventory as you see below to combine the gemstones with the telescope parts.



Arrange the items in that shape to obtain Lafi Bedmountain’s Upgraded Telescope.(Materials can be combined without appraising the compass parts as long as the correct compass parts are in their proper slot.)

Subtópico: Agris Fever
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
Agris is an ancient Balenosian god of prosperity and abundance that left a certain power for future generations to use. You can inherit this power to activate Agris Fever, which increases the amount of junk items dropped when defeating monsters and gathering.

This feature helps Adventurers with barely time to play to reap the maximum amount of profit from their in-game labors.


◈ How to Active Agris Fever
The Agris Fever feature will automatically activate upon reaching Lv. 56. At first, you will recover 15,000 Agris Fever points each day for a maximum of 50,000 points. Once activated, talk to the Black Spirit to start the Adventure Log: Agris, the Ancient Secret quest. As you complete each chapter of the Book of Margahan Adventure Log, you will be able to increase your maximum point capacity and amount of recovered points per day.



Above, you can see the Book of Margahan shelved in your Adventure Log bookshelf window, accessible from the main menu (hotkey: Esc).



◈ How to Use Agris Fever
Agris Fever will automatically activate upon reaching Lv. 56 for the first time and can be used by all characters in your family.

You start with a 50,000 point cap and will recover up to 15,000 points every day at 6 AM.Depending on how much of the Book of Margahan in the Adventure Log you have completed, your point cap can be increased up to 100,000 with the ability to recover up to 20,000 points daily. The Book of Margahan can be found in your Adventure Log and comes in two volumes which can be completed at Lv. 58 and Lv. 60 respectively.You can also increase the junk loot item drop rate from an extra 100% to an extra 150%.

You can proceed with the Adventure Log by accepting the quest Adventure Log: Agris, the Ancient Secret from the Black Spirit.



Above, you can see Agris Fever being active by the feature’s icon being in movement. As described in the tooltip, right-click the icon to toggle the feature on and off.

Defeating monsters and gathering items while Agris Fever is toggled on will increase your junk loot item drop rate by an extra 100% (150% if you complete the first 5 chapters of the books).

Agris Fever points decrease every time you defeat a monster or gather an object in the world. Once you consume all points, the junk loot item drop rate will return to normal.

Remember that you can stack Agris Fever with item drop rate increase buffs. There are various combinations possible, and many Adventurers have researched what works best for every given situation.


◈ Agris Fever for Gathering
Just as Agris Fever only applies to common (gray) items looted from monsters, its effects only apply to basic resources (such as tree and ore types) and not rare resources like Black Crystal Shards or special resources like Truffle Mushrooms.

When gathering with Agris Fever toggled on, you will consume the following points per attempt.


For example, after completing up to the Book of Margahan Vol. 1 Chapter 5, you will benefit from an Item Drop Amount +150% boost when Agris Fever is toggled on. If you attempt to gather Lion Meat, the following effects can be applied.

Subtópico: Adventure Log
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
During your journey throughout the world of Black Desert you’ll encounter many characters with their own problems and dreams. In some cases, these will have been written down into books. When you find yourself with such a case, you can retrace the steps the person took in the past, or carry out their dream, and receive rewards in return.

Once you unlock / obtain such a book, it will be added to your adventure log bookshelf.You can access the Adventure Log window through the main menu (hotkey: Esc) → Adventure (F5) → Adventure Log Bookshelf.



The adventure log bookshelf is a family-based feature where you can follow and rediscover various stories within the game through quests recorded in each book chapter. You can obtain great rewards every time you complete said quests.

As you move through each volume and shelf, you can obtain additional AP, DP, HP, stamina, weight limit, and other stats that will be applied to all characters in your family. This content can also increase the maximum amount of Agris fever points, which increases the amount of certain loot from monster zones and gathering, and Valks' cry that can be used to enhance equipment.

As such, we highly recommend unlocking and completing all the adventure logs that are available.


◈ The Basics
The adventure log bookshelf is divided into main themes, and each one contains one or more adventure logs. Within these you can find several volumes (books) that correspond to the log. Finally, each book will contain several pages with individual rewards for completing them.For example, within the Crow Merchants’ Records theme you will find the Caphras’ Record adventure log, which consists of four volumes. Each book consists of several pages, and completing them individually will reward you Caphras stones. Upon completing a volume, the next one will be unlocked.

To complete the individual pages (quests) of a book, you need to carry out the task for that page.The tasks asked of you in these adventure logs are varied. From completing other questlines, carrying out certain activities such as defeating monsters, doing a specific life skill activity, or exploring the world, to talking with NPCs and giving them certain items, and more.

At first, you will see the Reward button at the bottom of the page, where the reward is shown, appear in gray (①). Upon completing the page’s objective, it will glow red and a checkmark will be added to the page’s goal above it (②). Once this happens, press the button. The button’s borders will turn red, and the page will receive a completion stamp (③).



The rewards will be received the moment you press the button. If they’re items, they will be found in your character’s inventory. If they’re stats, they will be automatically applied to your family.

It is important to know that you cannot proceed with each adventure log right away, as they are unlocked once certain conditions are met. Below is a table that shows the adventure logs available, and the necessary conditions to unlock & proceed with them.

• Reach Lv. 51• Complete one of the following quests:• Looking for Adventurers, [Boss] Witch of Horrors, or [Special Growth] Fughar's Memorandum - Chapter 6

(All the quests mentioned above represent the completion of the main questline of Calpheon, either for most characters, those created before the questline’s revamp in 2018, or for season characters.)
• Reach Lv. 57• Complete the [Adventure Log] Shakatu Merchants' Archive quest via the Black Spirit.Completing the quest unlocks the following 3 logs at once:
– Deve's Encyclopedia
– Alustin's Alchemy
– Dorin Morgrim's Secrets
Crow Merchants’ Records
(Rulupee’s Travels, Lamute Gang’s Adventures, Caphras’ Record, Fughar’s Road to Success)

Outside these, there also exists a theme for event adventure logs. These tend to be centered around seasonal festivities that occur only once per year, and can only be progressed and completed during the event’s duration.


◈ What Can You Obtain from Adventure Logs?
As you complete each chapter (page), you will be able to obtain their specified rewards.



You can obtain the specified rewards after completing the objective of a certain chapter, which will also unlock the next chapter.

Subtópico: Friend List
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
You can see which of your friends are currently online, and also how much time has passed since they were last online if they are not. Their class icon, character level, and family & character names are displayed.
Right click on any of their names and a small window will appear with various options:

– Invite them to a party.– Remove them from the list.– Start a 1:1 chat with them.– Whisper them.

A whisper is the traditional way of sending and receiving private messages between Adventurers, and uses the game’s overall chat window system.
▲ Example of the 1:1 Chat interface.

You may have noticed that a blue figure appears in one of the messages above. That’s a papu, a race in Black Desert’s world. The 1:1 Chat interface allows the use of emojis.
▲ A group of friends you party up with to complete Atoraxxion’s dungeons is a good idea!

By clicking on the three dots to the right of a group’s name you can change its name or delete it.You can change the names of the groups you make any time you want.

Subtópico: Party & Platoon
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
You may have seen certain quests that recommend being tackled by a group of Adventurers instead of doing it alone. While at times you’re able to progress through them alone, you will certainly need to party up with others at one point or another. That’s where these features come into play.

A party is a small group of up to 5 Adventurers, while a platoon is a larger group of up to 20 Adventurers.

Please keep in mind that while being in a party makes your experience battling against strong monsters easier, boss encounters during the main questline might not work when you’re in a party. For these cases, please leave the party and proceed with the quest affected.Likewise, certain content of the game can only be proceeded when the one starting said content is the party leader.


◈ Invite
You can create a party mainly in two ways.Get closer to another Adventurer, press the Ctrl key to activate the mouse cursor, and press the ‘Party Invite’ button that appears when interacting with them.Alternatively, you can click on their name in chat after they’ve said something, and invite them through there. Remember that this only works if the other Adventurer is on the same server as you.

After a party is created, you need to have the mouse cursor active to use party-related functions.

To invite another Adventurer to a platoon, you need to click their name in chat and invite them through there.


▲ Here you can see both options to invite an Adventurer to a party and a platoon.


◈ Party Options
The party leader can always change the loot acquisition method, banish a party member from the group, or delegate the position of party leader to another Adventurer.



When leaving a party, click the red icon next to your character’s name.



When banishing an Adventurer or delegating the position of party leader, click on the relevant Adventurer’s arrow to the right of their name to see the options appear.



The icons next to the different Adventurers in your party show the distance they’re away from you, which affects the experience sharing function, and a follow icon to stick with them. This last option will change your character to a non-combat stance if they are in one. If the Adventurer you’re following enters combat stance, the follow action will be canceled.





If you have a Value Pack active, an icon to the left will tell you so. The benefit of a Value Pack also works for loot sold in the Central Market through the Special Deals window.



The [-] icon to the left allows you to resize the party options to take less space.



The gear icon to the left allows you to set the different party distribution options: both silver quantity and grade rarity.





When you banish a party member, a window will appear to confirm your decision.



The platoon interface is simpler. It gives you the option to leave the platoon you’re in, and if you’re the platoon leader it allows you to designate someone else as the new platoon leader or banish them from it.




◈ Find Party & Platoon
You can find party and platoon members easily through the Find Party/Platoon feature.You can find it through the Main Menu (hotkey: Esc), in the Community tab.



You can see a list of other Adventurers looking for party and platoon members.If there are too many on the list, you can search recruitment ads through the search window.



If you can’t find a party you want, you can press the Post Ad button at the top left of the window and recruit members for your party or platoon yourself. Compose a recruitment ad, set the minimum level of party members, and register it. After this, it will be visible to other Adventurers.



You can advertise a recruitment ad that you’ve registered on the chat window via the megaphone button to the left of its name.You can advertise it as a server message on the chat window once every minute, but keep in mind it costs 1 energy per message. If you want to join a party on the list, press the Apply button to the right.If the relevant party of Adventurers and you are on different servers, the Change Server button will be shown, and you can go to the same server that party is located in by pressing the button. After moving to the relevant server, you can see the Apply button displayed on the same recruitment ad. If you press it, your class and level information is relayed to the party leader, and they can invite you to the group.


◈ Party Advantages
Party members are displayed on the World Map screen (hotkey: M) and the minimap on the top right corner of your screen, and they can share their location by pressing the key combo Shift+LMB on their own world map, or by pinning the location as a flag through the key combo Shift+double click.



You can use this function to share one’s location in the minimap as well.If a party member is too far away, the direction where the party member is at is displayed with a blue arrow.

▲ Percentages of EXP distribution in a party.
If a monster is supposed to give X amount of EXP, if you catch it alone you will get the 100% by yourself.If two people become a party and defeat monsters your party will get 120% in total, and 60%, half of the total, will be shared per person.So in this form, if there are 5 people in a party, a monster’s EXP goes up to 250%, and each person gets 50%. Because of this, it is more beneficial the more party members there are. However, if party members are far away, they can’t get this benefit.The party distance bonus icon, which looks like a Wi-Fi signal, will show you if they’re close or not. You can earn the full amount of EXP when the icon is full.



Via the Party Distribution options you can decide how an item earned by the party leader should be processed. First, set the loot acquisition type and then check the party distribution options.Acquisition types decide how to divide items looted from monsters, and they are categorized into free looting, ordered looting, random looting, and party leader-only looting. The party distribution options work in the following way.When an item that is above a set quality grade (green, blue, yellow, orange) is dropped, it will be registered as a special item on the Central Market right away. Special items registered on the Central Market this way are put on sale. When one of these items is sold, the silver obtained is divided by the number of party members. If you click the View Special Item button before listing a special item, you can buy the relevant item yourself through bidding, or by throwing a dice.This amount will be divided into the number of party members, and if you win the dice roll, the item is delivered through the in-game mail feature. While you can party up with other Adventurers for all PvE Monster Zones, some are specially prepared for this. Both the World Map (hotkey: M) and the Monster Zone Information window (accessed from the main menu) will label the zones that are meant for parties of Adventurers.


◈ Party Elixirs
While you are in a party with other Adventurers, it is helpful to prepare elixirs for everybody.You will see which elixirs these are because they have [Party] in their name.



If the party distance bonus is activated, this elixir is immediately applied to everyone in the group.

There are two options for binding larger groups together in the world of Black Desert. The first of these is called a clan, while the second is a guild. This page will focus on the former.

➤ You can read more about guilds in the [Guild] page.
Clans can be created by Adventurers who wish to keep connected with one another, exchange information and socialize. It supports up to 15 members, but they have some restrictions. Below you can compare a clan’s functions with those of a guild.

As one can see, the functionalities of a clan are severely limited. They cannot participate in Node & Conquest War, cannot register or use guild mounts, cannot do guild missions, use guild skills, nor take part in guild wars. They are more like a social hub for small groups of Adventurers.


◈ How to Create & Disband
Anyone can create a clan by talking to a Guild Manager NPC.




Once a clan has been created, you can pull up the Clan window by pressing the G key. This will show you all of the clan members, their family and character names, classes, levels, positions, and whether or not they are online. To invite a new Adventurer to join your clan, you must be in the same server channel, and standing near one another. Then you can use the interaction menu to send the invitation.

Disbanding a clan is also easy. You just need to press the Disband Clan button while there is no one in the clan.


◈ Promotion to Guild
If you find your circle of companions growing, or want to participate in more group-oriented activities, you can spend 100,000 silver to convert your clan into a guild by talking with a Guild Manager NPC, such as Luciano Pietro in Heidel.

If promoted to a guild, the original clan name is kept.

➤ You can read more about clans in the [Clan] page.

A guild is a group of people who have gathered together for a particular purpose.
There is a lot of exclusive content that can only be conducted if you are a member of a guild, and the reward for the various activities can be shared by all the guild members.



Tip!
Conditions to creating a clan/guild
- You have no clan or guild that you’ve already registered to.
- 24hours must have passed after leaving clan/guild.
- You can make guild name only in English/numbers, and you can’t use blank or special characters..

Guilds, unlike clans, can participate in node & conquest wars, guild wars and take guild missions. Guilds can also host Arena of Arsha matches.
While most guild members have access to the guild shop, only high ranking guild members can purchase items such as structures for conquest wars, or supplies for naval combat, from it. Any items purchased from the guild shop are paid for directly from the guild funds, so discretion should be used when selecting higher ranking guild members, as well as which items to purchase.

If guild funds drop too low, the guild leader can deposit a small amount of silver, or purchases may be taken from high ranking members’ own silver. Fund depletion can cause no end of disruptions in a guild, so it is wise to maintain funds with missions.


In order to register your guild's emblem, which serves as the guild’s face, you need to buy the [Guild] Emblem Certificate item from any Guild Manager NPC.
You can register the guild emblem in the guild window (hotkey: G) after making a 60x60 pixel ‘Gmark.png’ picture file into the ‘My Documents/Black Desert’ folder.



But keep in mind you can only register and change the guild emblem on a Monday, and you must wait 1 hour before it can be changed again.



You can click the guild window's Register/Change Guild Emblem button while holding a [Guild] Emblem Certificate item.



A confirmation window like the above will appear when registering the new emblem.



When you invite a new player to the guild, you offer them a contract with certain terms. You can set the duration of the contract (contract terms are 1 day, 7 days, 14 days, 30 days, 180 days, or 365 days), their daily allotment of funds (within a certain range), and the fee for member termination (within a certain range). If a contracted player leaves your guild, they automatically pay that fee directly to the guild funds, whereas a member kicked from the guild will be paid 3 times the daily pay from the guild funds.



In order for an Adventurer to receive the benefits of being a part of the guild, such as any EXP bonus, HP increase, or damage increase from guild skills, they must have an active contract. You can check this by going to the Guild Member Status tab of the Guild window. In the rightmost column of that tab you will see a status symbol for each member, indicating the status of their contract.



Once an Adventurer’s contract has expired, you must renew their contract for them to contribute to the guild and receive guild benefits. As with guild invitations, contracts can be renewed in any channel/server.

When renewing the contract, you can increase 1% of current pay for 100 points of current activity level, and the increase can be limited to 100% for each contract.

For example, if your current pay is 30,000 silver coins and activity level is 10,000, you can renew the contract at a maximum of 60,000 silver coins.

Renewal can be done at least once a day, and it is renewed at midnight server time.


Conditions of joining a guild
- A guild is shared across your family of characters, so you can only be in 1 guild per account.- You can’t register to a different / same guild within 24 hours of leaving a guild.







Unlike in a clan, you can appoint an advisor and officers in a guild.
There can only be one guild advisor, and they help the guild master oversee the guild.
Guild officers help the guild master manage the guild with their increased authority. There are no limits to the number of officers a guild can appoint.
The guild master can even choose to appoint everyone, or no one, as guild officers.
• Guild Master
The person in charge of the guild. Since it holds a lot of authority, it has many responsibilities as well.If you compare a guild to a company, the guild master is akin to the CEO.
If the guild master is unavailable for a long period of time, there is a big possibility that the guild won’t function properly.

• Advisor
The advisor is granted much of the guild master’s authority to help oversee the guild.It can also learn guild skills and use all of them except for the Battle Command to Gather one.However, if the guild master is online and on the same server channel, the advisor can use the Battle Command to Gather as well.

• Staff
Guild staff have the general rights of an officer, and help the guild master and advisor in managing the guild. They have responsibilities that only the guild master and advisor previously had, such as the appointment of members to certain positions, allowance distribution, obtaining guild skills, managing guild house production, setting guild protection capacity / appointing guild protection, transferring guild mount equipment (removing & equipping gear), guild drill retrieval, and applying/reserving for Arena of Arsha. Like the secretary, they can also expel members from the guild.There can be up to 3 guild staff in a guild.

• Secretary
The secretary is in charge of managing guild points. They have the rights of an officer, with the additional responsibilities of approving / rejecting point forms and expelling members. There can only be one secretary per guild.
• Guild Officer
With a degree of given authority, guild officers help manage the guild and support the guild master.
Using the company analogy again, they would be like administrators.

• Quartermaster
The quartermasters are in charge of managing supplies for war.They can purchase and use most of the war supplies in the guild shop.

• Cannoneer
Similar to the quartermaster position, cannoneers can install annexes during node and conquest wars.Cannoneers can also purchase war supplies in the guild shop with their allowance.

• Mission Specialist
Mission specialists have the general rights of other positions, with the specialized responsibility of accepting and completing guild missions.There is no limit to the number of appointed mission specialists.
• Guild Members
If you register to a guild, you automatically become a general guild member after a period of trial where you are denoted as an apprentice.You can use most of the guild contents and features, but do not have the right to operate the guild itself.

Regarding the reissue / renewal of membership contracts, please note the following:Any rank above officer can renew their own contract, and the contracts of any rank below them. Officers can renew all member type (mission specialist, cannoneer, quartermaster, and general member) contracts, but not their own.

① Notice
Can write down the guild notice to be shared with guild members. It is only available to the guild master and ranks including officer and above.

②  Guild Status Buttons
Here you can find several options.
– You can open the Guild Activity Reward window to collect pending rewards.
– You can open the Find Guild Party / Platoon window to check if any guild member wants to team up with others, and to write your own ad to request assistance.
– The Post Guild Recruitment Notice window allows you to do that and check the list of recruitment notices of other guilds, separated by type: Combat, Life, Sailing, and Adventure.
– You can write down an introductory description of the guild in the Register Guild Intro window that is visible to all the guild members. This is also only available to the guild master and ranks including officer and above.
– You can apply for a vacation from guild duties via the Apply for Vacation window. While on vacation a guild member cannot collect their daily pay, take part in guild missions, and won’t be affected by guild skills. If a war hero was hired in their place, when the guild member returns from their vacation they will need to wait for the contract with the war hero to end.
– The Leave the Guild button will allow you to exit the guild you’re in. Keep in mind that you cannot join other guilds for the next 24 hours after leaving one.

③ Saying of the day
This serves the function of a guild-only noteboard where all guild members can write down messages they want to share. It is only shared within the guild.

④ Guild Scale Increase
You can increase the maximum guild member capacity of a guild to a maximum of 100 Adventurers.As the scale of the guild increases, the maximum capacity of allowed guild members and protection capacity will increase accordingly.
The scale of the guild is decided by the number of people who joined it, apart from the maximum member capacity.

⑤ Increasing Guild Protection Capacity
Other than the protection capacity that is provided, the maximum protection capacity can be increased by using the guild’s score.
The maximum protection capacity can increase up to 10% of the current maximum number of guild members, and if the maximum capacity of members reaches 100 Adventurers, the basic protection capacity of 10 members increases to an additional 10, so 20 Adventurers can be set as protected.
Every time the protection capacity increases by one person, 1 guild score is spent. The guild member that is set as protection capacity can’t be attacked by an enemy guild member, but if the enemy guild member activates forced attack (ALT+C), can be attacked.

⑥ Declaration of war
You can declare war towards other guilds here. Only available to the guild master and ranks including officer and above.You can declare war to a maximum of 6 other guilds, and each declaration costs 150,000 silver taken from the guild funds.Guilds with active guild wars or in possession of a node or territory cannot declare war on guilds not on the same conditions as them.A guild not in war with another guild and not in control of a node or territory can declare war on any other guild.

Please note that the karma of guild members in a warring guild will not decrease while pursuing the conflict objectives.

⑦ Guild storage
This button opens the guild’s storage. It can only be opened while in a town with storage, such as Velia or Heidel.

⑧ Guild information
This button opens the Guild Information page, where Adventurers can see the guild’s introduction and lets them write messages in the guild’s guestbook.

⑨ Guild war
From the left, there are buttons for penalty applicability / request to end the war / withdraw from war.




If you add an ! (exclamation mark) in front of the chat sentence, you can show your message on the top center of the game screen to all the guild members who are connected.

If a guild member in the same server channel is defeated during a guild war, the location is shown as a skull on your world map.
It is the easiest way to check in which area your guild members are having a fight.

Additionally, guild members from the same guild are displayed as green marks on both the minimap and the world map.



Guild funds start with a minimum of 80,000 silver coins at the moment of creating a guild.No one can withdraw them, and they are used only for the operation of a guild.


◈ How to obtain guild funds
1. Guild mission
The most basic way to obtain guild funds is by completing guild missions.Depending on the size and the type of guild mission, the silver reward differs.

2. Conquest/Node war
If there are many guild members who like PvP and you want to earn more guild funds, you can participate in conquest and node wars.
If you win, you will be able to obtain a part of the territory tax as guild funds.
You can earn guild funds up to hundreds of millions of silver even if you only conquer level 1 nodes.

The tax that was earned from winning conquest or node wars can only be collected on the server channel where the war happened. For example, if you want to collect the tax from the Southern Guard Camp node that is included in the territory of Serendia, you have to move to the Serendia 1 server channel. If you don’t collect it until 15 minutes before the next conquest or node war starts, the tax gets collected automatically, and it automatically collects again 5 minutes before the conquest or node war.



Any guild with at least 30 members can distribute guild bonuses.
Guild bonuses can be distributed once every seven days, and can be up to 40% of your guild funds. They can only be distributed by the guild master and their advisor.

Points are allotted based on guild activity, and bonuses are allotted based on those accumulated points. Unlike the accumulated guild activity based on your contribution to guild experience, guild points are used solely for bonuses and disappear when paid.
Though there is a default setting for how points are distributed based on guild activity, such settings can be changed to whatever fits the guild's preferences.

As for guild members, all they need to do is submit a point form based on their accumulated guild activity. This will set the incentive level for when bonuses are allotted.However, when participating in node & conquest wars, such point forms are submitted automatically.
The one in charge of the point form applications is the guild secretary. They help the guild leader to make point application management more convenient.

Once all point applications are submitted and managed, the guild masters and advisors are able to distribute the bonuses right away. For those who have completed special activities in addition to the designated activities, their bonuses can be manually distributed.
In this system, points can be allotted to all members to be used on special occasions or guild events, and guild allowances can be adjusted in bulk.

Points can be obtained by participating in node & conquest wars and by submitting the guild point form.
Remember that accumulated points are used to set the incentive level automatically during payout, according to the criteria set by the guild master.

The set point criteria stays in place until it is changed, regardless of when the payout occurs, and the incentive level can be changed whenever the guild master wishes.


◈ Guild Point Form
Guild members can apply for guild points through the guild point form.The guild points obtained through the form depend on the guild activity criteria set by the guild master or advisor.

Points are obtained when the form is approved by the guild master, advisor, or secretary. However, these point forms are submitted automatically when participating in node & conquest wars.



How to Check the Guild Activity History of Other Members

Click the "Point History" icon that looks like a scroll at the top of the Guild Member Status tab.Anyone can check the details of other guild members' points.





The most basic method to gain guild score is to complete guild missions.
Depending on the size and type of the guild, from a minimum of 500 to a maximum of 24,000 guild skill EXP can be obtained per mission. If the guild accomplishes 100% of the guild skill EXP, the guild earns 2 guild points.

As the size of the guild mission increases, and the time limit is higher, the guild can earn more guild skill score.


◈ Increasing the Level and Skills of Guild Members
For new Adventurers who can’t help with guild missions because of their low level, they can contribute to the guild’s growth by increasing their character combat level and life skills levels.

Although in smaller quantities than with guild missions, the new Adventurer will be much faster in increasing its character combat level and life skills levels, so they can earn guild activity quicker than one might expect.



Guild missions are based on guild size, with scaling rewards as well as challenges. However, missions are not unique to each guild, and you must compete for them. Additionally, guilds can only complete 10 missions in a day, so choosing missions wisely is extremely important.

The goal for most missions is to accomplish the goal within the limited time given.

If the guild fails to accomplish the goal within the given time, it must give up the mission. If the guild presses to forfeit the guild mission, guild points can’t be earned. When forfeiting, the number of available missions doesn’t come back. The list of available guild missions refreshes every 10 minutes.

For the different guild missions, the needed number of Adventurers differs depending on the mission scale.The recommended number of Adventurers are 1 ~ 5 for small, 6 ~ 10 for medium, 10 ~ 15 for large, and 16 ~ 20 for extra large. If there are guild members with high levels and great equipment, the recommended required number of participants decreases.

The details about each mission can be checked by pressing it in the list of missions.



Once you have chosen the mission you want to attempt, remember that there must be at least 3 guild members online at any given time for one to accept a guild mission, and that whatever mission you choose will be timed.



If you complete the mission during the allotted time, a high ranking member of the guild must turn it in for the guild to collect the reward. If you fail, the guild earns nothing.


◈ Combat Mission
Combat missions are mostly made up of defeating monsters in monster zones. This way you can carry out a guild mission as well as obtain combat experience to level up.

When carrying out a combat mission, it is important to select not just the size, but select the area depending on the level of the different guild members.

The level of the monsters differs depending on the area, so the difficulty of guild missions differs as well. Additionally, even if the size and the area is the same, if the time limit is longer, it is generally a more difficult mission.


◈ Life & Trading Missions
Life missions are made up of gathering, fishing and trading, and have the advantage of leveling the various life skills while carrying on with a guild mission.

If the guild members' levels are low, and there are many guild members who enjoy life skill content, life missions are recommended. Gathering and fishing quests are displayed in a green gathering icon, and trade ones are displayed with a brown trade wagon icon.

Out of the life missions, trade missions are only suggested for guilds with strong teamwork, since the level of difficulty is high, and require to spend the guild members’ own funds and restricting skills, as well as having the guild master join in as well.



Tip!
[Boss Subjugation] missions will reward scroll pieces that, when put together, allow the guild to challenge powerful bosses for increased rewards.
➤ You can read more about this feature in the [Guild Boss] page.



As guild members contribute with their guild activity, the guild will gain experience. This will grant the guild with guild points, which can be used to purchase guild skills. You can also use these points to increase the size scale of the guild.

Guild skills grant bonuses to members of the guild, or unlock guild specific advancements, such as a larger guild storage with more slots, or the ability to build a nursery for elephants and a shipyard to build guild galleys in.

➤ You can read more about these two options in the [Guild Mounts] page.

Only the highest guild ranks can put points into skills, and there is currently no reset option available.

Out of the various guild skills, there are passive skills that can be applied right after learning them, and active types of skill that are applied for a certain period of time when used.




◈ Skills Related to Combat
Out of the combat-related skills, there is Furious Roar (all accuracy rate +X%), Battle Roar (all AP increase), Flame of Life (Max HP increase), Keen Insight (evasion rate +X%), and Flame of Protection (damage reduction +X%).

They are guild skills that are useful for both PvE and PvP, so if there are a lot of guild members who like those, they are guild skills that should be considered first.




◈ Related to Life Skills
Out of the life skills ones, there are Nimble Fingers (gathering level increase), Art of Fishing (fishing level increase), and Skilled Rider (trade item protection +X%). Out of these, the most popular ones are Nimble Fingers and Art of Fishing, as the Skilled Rider one is not as efficient.

If there are a lot of guild members who like gathering and crafting, learning life skill-related guild skills is highly recommended. However, compared to the combat skills, these consume a lot of guild score points, so it is better to learn them according to the life skill level of the guild members.


◈ Related to Conquest & Node wars
For skills related to both conquest and node war, there are Blessing (siege weapon damage resistance +X%), Call of the Lord (increases max HP +500 for 10 minutes only during conquest wars), Command to Gather (teleports guild members to your location) and Commander’s Signal (annex construction time -X% during node & conquest wars).

After you reach level 5 on Furious Roar and Battle Roar, you can learn Call of the Lord.If you reach level 5 on Flame of Life and Flame of Protection, you can learn Command to Gather.

Please remember that Command to Gather has a long cool time after using it (4 hours).

It is a powerful skill where you can gather all the guild members at the same time who are in the same server with the guild master, except some special cases like those who are in a desert area.



This is a feature that allows PvP anywhere in the world, no matter the level of the guild members, between 2 guilds after a declaration of war has been issued.

It is possible to declare war without the opposing guild’s consent, but you need the opposing guild’s consent for the war to start. A guild can declare war upon 6 other guilds at the same time at most.

If the guild master or the one who started the war presses the Stop button, they can stop the war right away.

However, remember that calling off a guild war can only be done 1 hour after the declaration of war has been issued.

Declaring and ending guild wars, and checking the guild’s war status, can be done through the Guild window.

Please also note that during a guild war, if you are positive karma, you won't be affected by death penalties.



In a guild, most of the rights are focused on the guild master, so if they do not log in for a long time, the guild’s functions might not work well and the members might experience some discomfort. If this happens, the delegate guild master function can be used to transfer the guild’s top leadership position.

There are two ways of delegating the guild master position, and the amount of guild funds that will be consumed and the necessary condition for each differs.

For the first, if the guild master does not log in for 15 days, the advisor can use 20 million silver from the guild funds to delegate the position.

For the second, the guild master can delegate the position to their advisor, or any other member with the position of officer or higher, voluntarily. But in this case, there are more conditions to be met than not having to log in for a while.

• Delegation is not allowed if the guild owns a territory, node, or guild house.• If there are items in the guild storage and guild stable, delegation is not allowed.• If there are guild items in the guild master’s inventory, delegation is not allowed.
• The position of guild master can only be delegated to an officer or higher that is currently active (online).

When delegation happens, 50% of the guild’s fund will be deducted.

If an elephant in the guild stable is wearing equipment, or the guild master has a guild item, delegation is not allowed, so you must look to see if the conditions are met when deciding to do this.



Guilds cannot be disbanded while guild items are still contained in guild member inventories or the guild’s storage. Additionally, members cannot leave the guild while they have possession of such items.

Finally, there should be no conquest nor node war fort built if the guild wants to be disbanded.



You can check the guild rank by going to the main menu (hotkey: Esc) and checking the Guild Rankings window.



Basically, the list is displayed in the order of the guild with the most points coming first, and if the guild score is the same, the rank is decided based on experience points.

The number of guild members, if the guestbook and the guild description have been updated, and the life skill level of the guild members, can be used to look up the guild rank, so if you check the guild rank you can see which guild focuses on what they enjoy in Black Desert.

In the Guild Rankings window, if you put your cursor over a guild’s name, you can check the simple guild description, and if you click the guild name, you move to the relevant guild page and can read the detailed guild introduction and check their guestbook.

These various standards will help each Adventurer on selecting their ideal guild based on their preferred playstyle.
* The content of the game guide may differ from the actual game content, depending on the update and content changes.

Subtópico: Guild Mounts
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
Guild mounts are not owned by an individual, but a guild. As such, anyone that is a member of the guild can use them if their guild has obtained them. In this way, they are made useful to many Adventurers instead of just one.

Like all mounts, guild mounts are divided into land and sea mounts. The land guild mounts are elephants, which play an important role in Node War and Conquest War when destroying barricades and defensive structures, while the sea one is the galley, useful when needing to transport a large number of guild members across the sea.



Above you can see the Cadria elephant, the land guild mount a guild can obtain.


A guild needs to get a guild house through an auction and open an elephant nursery. You’ll need the guild skill Monstrous Force to open the nursery. The guild house auctions in the territory of Valencia are held at the capital city of Valencia and in Sand Grain Bazaar.



The guild master needs to open the elephant nursery in the guild house to raise the elephant.Guild members can send their workers to the guild house to help raise it.


■ Guild House Auction

1. The auction starts every other Friday at 6:00 PM and finishes after 24 hours.

2. Only guild masters can bid in the auction. They can place bids through the guild managers in the towns of Olvia, Velia, Heidel, Calpheon, Altinova, Sand Grain Bazaar, and Valencia.

3. The starting price is set at the price the previous owner won their bids with. If no one bids on a guild house, then its starting price is decreased by 50%. You need to collect your previous bid before placing a new bid.

4. You can bid up to 3 times. You cannot bid on multiple guild houses during an auction. Therefore, you can bid 2 more times on the guild house you placed your first bid on.

5. This is a blind auction. You cannot know who or how much the other people participating bid for the house. A system message will tell you if you won the bid or not.

6. Mail is sent to the guild master that won the bid. The maintenance fee for the guild is 5% of the winning bid, and is paid at midnight every day using guild funds.

7. The auction is extended by 1 minute every time someone places a bid within 2 minutes or less before the auction ends. Additionally, the auction will get extended by 24 hours if there are guild houses that no one bid on. You can use your guild house until the start of the next guild house auction.


Guild house auctions tend to be nerve-wracking due to being blind auctions.

Once you’ve obtained a guild house with a nursery, first you will need to tame a baby elephant and raise it. Baby elephants can be found on the plains and wild regions of Valencia.

You tame baby elephants the same way you tame horses.Use a rope, then toss it towards the elephant and tie it. After this, use the direction keys to move towards it. Remember to continuously hit the spacebar to calm the baby elephant if it raises its front legs.

Once you reach the baby elephant, open your inventory and feed it [Guild] Desert Peanut until it‘s satisfied. You can purchase the peanuts through the Guild Stable Keeper NPC using your guild funds. You will successfully tame the baby elephant as long as the baby elephant doesn’t kick you and runs away.

The baby elephant will follow you if you have successfully tamed it. Bring it to the Guild Stable Keeper NPC and click on the Register button.The baby elephant will be exchanged for an item used for guild crafting. Said item will appear inside your inventory.



The baby elephant will try to resist you by doing wild movements, so do your best to tame it.

Now you can place the baby elephant in your guild storage and send workers to raise it.Please note that you cannot raise the tamed baby elephant before you register it.

The rest of the materials required can be bought from the guild shop.You can craft the elephant using a processing option called Guild Processing (hotkey: L). It can only be done within the guild house. Read the Crafting Notes (hotkey: F1 or F2, then press Crafting Notes in the top right) for more details.




You can watch the elephant actually grow in size in real time.



Some of the materials needed can only be made in the guild house through the processing option Guild Processing.

The clearance permits are obtained when giving clearance requests to a Guild Manager NPC.The clearance requests are crafted via the Guild Processing function (hotkey: L). The materials required for the clearance requests can also be crafted via the Guild Processing function.

The fully grown elephant will be placed in the guild storage as a mount registration emblem.Take it to the Guild Stable Keeper NPC and register it to complete the procedure. The elephant can make a big impact on the battlefield!

It isn’t cheap to raise a Cadria elephant. However, it is fast, has quite a bit of HP, and good acceleration, handling, brakes, and physical abilities. It also comes with 5 skills that are useful on the battlefield.



Even the appearance of the Cadria elephant is intimidating!

Like for those, there are two methods to obtain a guild galley.


◈ Getting a Guild Galley I: Completing Quests
One option is to start the quest [Guild] I Have a Dream that only the guild master can access and complete. If you are the guild master, you can find the quest by opening the Quest window (hotkey: O), and going to the Suggested tab where you will see it listed.

This quest will ask you to give NPC Yan x150 [Guild] Old Moon Combat Seal and x150 [Guild] Old Moon Life Seal, the same items needed for the elephant quests, and will directly reward you with a [Guild] Ship License: Galley mount emblem.



It is important to note that a guild can have up to 3 guild galleys, but a guild master cannot do this quest more than once. To obtain the other 2 possible guild galleys, a single guild master will need to craft them.

Once you’ve obtained the ship license for the galley, you can go to any Guild Wharf Manager NPC to register it as a mount. Both the guild master and the guild officers can take the galley in and out of the wharf.


◈ Getting a Guild Galley II: Guild House
The other option requires a guild to get a guild house through an auction and open a shipyard. You’ll need the guild skill Building Boat to open the shipyard. The guild house you will need to win the auction for to get access to a shipyard is in the territories of Balenos, Calpheon, and Mediah.



The guild master needs to open the shipyard in the guild house to enable the crafting of the galley.Guild members can send their workers to the guild house to help build it.


Out of these materials, the galley plans require guild members to raise amity with Philaberto Falasi in Port Epheria and purchase it from him.




➤ You can read more about this topic in the [Amity] page.

The clearance permits are obtained when giving clearance requests to a Guild Manager NPC.The clearance requests are crafted via the Guild Processing function (hotkey: L). The materials required for the clearance requests can also be crafted via the Guild Processing function.

All the other materials can be either crafted by guild members or purchased from a Guild Wharf Manager NPC.

Finally, once all materials have been gathered, deposit them in the guild storage. Now you can craft the guild galley.


Making a guild mount is a difficult process.Guild Mounts are made with the sacrifice and support of your guild members.

The elephants can be used to help your guild achieve victory in Node and Siege War. Especially on the offensive, they are very effective in destroying barricades and defensive structures, and can block the access point of enemies if they have the skill Fore Chop.​

As for guild galleys, they serve as group transport ​​​​​​at sea for your guild’s activities, such as going to hunt sea monsters or challenge Khan, Eye of the Great Ocean.

NA16:00 pm EST13:00 pm PDT
From the moment they begin, guild house auctions are active for 24h, and the houses presented in them are always bought using guild funds. Only guild masters can bid on guild houses.

The auction is announced through in-game notices when it starts. Designated NPCs for the auction, the guild managers of each town, will start to accept bids for the local guild houses once it has started.During the auction, you can only bid on a single house. As such, make sure to choose the correct one for your needs, as otherwise you will need to wait another 2 weeks.

You have three chances to bid. The auction is a blind auction, so you won’t see who is bidding for the houses, nor how much the other guilds are bidding for them. However, a message saying “Your bid of silver has been placed as the highest bid.” will appear when you place the highest bid. This way, you will know if you currently have the highest bid or not for your chosen house.

The auction is extended by 1 minute every time someone places a bid within 2 minutes or less before the auction ends. Additionally, the auction will get extended by 24 hours if there are guild houses that no one bid on. You can use your guild house until the start of the next guild house auction.

If you win the auction, the guild funds will be removed and your guild can use the house. If you do not win, you can go to the Guild Manager NPC and collect the guild funds employed during the auction.


◈ Guild House Maintenance
Guilds that own a guild house pay a maintenance fee every day at midnight.The fee is automatically paid for using guild funds, and it’s proportional to the final price the house was bought with. The maintenance fee for the house is 5% of the winning bid.

If your guild is running low on guild funds, your use of the guild house might be limited.Arrears can be paid off using the guild master’s and officers’ silver.


◈ Guild House Functions
Guild points can be used to improve guild houses.Houses can be improved to allow for the crafting of different items, and expand their storage space.



– Storage
Guild members can access their guild storage through the door or windows of the guild house.



You can also access it by opening the Guild window (hotkey: G) while you are in a town.



Only items with “[Guild]” at the start of their names can be stored in a guild storage.



– Elephant Nursery & Shipyard
Purchasing the guild skills Monstrous Force and Building Boat will allow you to open elephant nurseries and shipyards in those guild houses that have that particular function.
For elephant nurseries, you will require one of the guild houses in Sand Grain Bazaar or Valencia City, while for shipyards you will need to obtain certain guild houses from the territories of Balenos, Calpheon, and Mediah.

➤ You can read more about this topic in the [Guild Mounts] page.


◈ Guild Processing & Crafting
Items required for guild crafting can only be made inside guild houses.You can place materials in the guild storage by interacting with the house’s door. Enter the guild house, then open the Processing window (hotkey: L) and select the Guild Processing tab to craft these items.This way, you can make permits and a variety of materials used in guild crafting.When you successfully make an item you receive guild activity points.

The Guild Crafting feature in one of the tabs of the Guild window uses items made through the guild processing function. Only guild masters can start the craft of an item via this function. However, guild members can send their workers to help crafting the item. Once finished, the complete item, such a siege weapon for example, will automatically be placed in your guild storage.Only the guild master can take these items out.All guild members that helped craft the item get guild activity points.

– Raising Elephants
You can raise baby elephants at your guild house (only in Valencia)As mentioned above, in order to raise elephants, your guild must have the skill Monstrous Force.Materials that are required to raise elephants can be bought though the guild shop or made through guild processing.You can make equipment for your elephant after getting the skill Monstrous Force Lv. 2 and opening a level 2 elephant nursery.

– Guild Galley
There are two different ways you can obtain a guild galley.One way is through a quest named [Guild] I Have a Dream which will ask you to give a determined amount of Old Moon Combat Seals and Old Moon Life Seals. This quest can be done once.The other way is to craft a guild galley at a guild shipyard. To do this, you must have the guild skill Building Boat mastered, as well as a guild house in one of the available guild houses with the shipyard function.
Like with the elephant nursery, improving the shipyard skill to Lv. 2 will allow you to make equipment for the guild galley.

– Crafting Parts
You can make items that recover your elephant’s endurance and guild galley’s power if your guild has the guild skill Fully Prepared.


◈ Losing a Guild House
All your guild house information, including its upgrades, stored items, and crafting progress is saved, so even if you lose your guild house permit to another guild in an auction round, you do not have to worry.However, you are restricted from using the guild house and can’t continue with guild crafting until your guild gets another permit to use it from winning the guild house auctions.

Subtópico: Guild Boss
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
Have you ever wanted to challenge a boss with your guild mates? There are a few boss encounters you can all face together! Guild bosses you can summon include Khan, Ancient Puturum, Ferrid, and the Giant Mudster.

These bosses can be summoned by obtaining summon scroll pieces by completing guild boss subjugation quests.



Head to the Guild Missions tab of the Guild window (hotkey: G), and search for those missions categorized as [Boss Subjugation]. Among the various rewards you are given for completing them, you will acquire summon scroll pieces for the different guild bosses.



As you and your guild mates obtain the required summon scroll pieces, the Guild Boss Subjugation tab will update, showing you how many pieces remain to be able to summon the boss.



After collecting the required amount of summon scroll pieces, your guild can summon the corresponding boss. You will see that the “Find Location” and “Summon” buttons have appeared where before it said “Summon condition not fulfilled.” Once you press the “Find Location” button and go to the location where the boss can be summoned, you can select the difficulty.




There is also a limited number of guild bosses which can be summoned per server at a time.If too many guild bosses have already been summoned on your current server, a system message will tell you that too many have already been summoned. In this case, you can either wait a while, or you can move to another server and summon a guild boss there.

After you’ve successfully summoned a guild boss, it will be reset on Monday at 00:00 UTC, so don’t forget to go challenge them with your guild on the weekends!

Boss summon scroll pieces do not reset from week to week. Likewise, available guild boss summons do not reset if the guild does not summon them.

Once you have summoned a boss for the week, you won’t be able to obtain new summon scroll pieces of that boss until the next weekly reset.



You can see what guild boss has been defeated during the week by the “Available Summon: 0/1” to the left and the stamp on the right.




Contrary to other guild bosses, once summoned, Khan will disappear 30 minutes after being summoned, regardless of battle progression.




◈ Guild’s Expedition Region
Unique to Khan as well is the Guild's Expedition Region instance, which lets guilds battle Khan without being interrupted by pirates and enemy guilds.Once you have all the summon scroll pieces to summon Khan, the guild master or the guild’s advisors can move to the island of Oquilla’s Eye where Khan dwells and open the Guild Boss UI to enter and create the Guild's Expedition Region instance.

Remember that you cannot be on a Node, Conquest, or Arsha server when you create and access the instance, and that you cannot access it if you have forced PvP active, if you’ve recently hit or defeated another Adventurer with forced PvP active, if you’re in a duel or mounted, if your character is not idle, or if you’re not in a “normal” zone such as the Elvia Realm.

The expedition region will remain open for 1 hour.Guild members can enter the instance when they approach the area in Oquilla’s Eye. However, keep in mind that only allied guild members and war heroes can enter.



Once the expedition region instance expires, all characters within will be moved outside the instance.


◈ Strategy
To defeat Khan, you must have the [Guild] Monsterbane Cannon Assembly Kit and [Guild] Monsterbane Cannonball items. This equipment can be obtained from a Guild Manager NPC by exchanging Old Moon combat/life seals, or purchased with guild funds at the guild shop.Each seal can be exchanged for one assembly kit or 10 cannonballs.

Note that the cannon assembly kit will be destroyed 30 minutes after being installed. When the assembly kit is destroyed, all the cannonballs inside will be deleted.

The [Guild] Monsterbane Cannon Assembly Kit item is different from other types of cannons. You can use stacks to use rapid fire or overcharge cannon skills. You can get these stacks by firing the cannon.On one hand, the charge time and cooldown are longer than with a normal cannon, but on the other, it has higher damage. More stacks result in higher damage output.You can press X to enter rapid fire mode when you have stacks built up. Rapid fire gives you faster reload speed and fire time. Using normal fire during rapid fire mode will give you stacks.

When Khan <Eye of the Great Ocean> is summoned, beware! You will receive damage when you step into the eye area the moment Khan appears.

Khan’s lightning attacks will preferentially target the Adventurer who did the most damage to Khan.

Khan will summon black crystal seaweeds during the encounter. If you don’t kill them, the battle can turn against you, as these will continue to summon protties until they are destroyed.



Destroying the black crystal seaweeds will also destroy the monsters summoned from it. You can acquire black crystal cannonballs, which are more powerful than monsterbane cannonballs, by destroying the black crystal seaweeds.Using the black crystal cannonball will make the battle a lot easier.

A caution message will be displayed when Khan prepares a strong attack. Use the surrounding landscape features to protect yourself from it!Luckily, there is no penalty for dying from Khan’s attacks, and you will be able to revive in Oquilla’s Eye via the “Resurrect at the closest Safe Zone” option if you’ve discovered the topography of Oquilla’s Eye.Remember this, as the “Resurrect at the closest Town” option will revive you in the nearest town.

Khan will prepare to heal itself once it loses a certain amount of HP.To stop its healing, you can either destroy the summoned black crystal seaweed or hit it with enough overcharged fire shots.

After successfully defeating Khan, you can swim out to the center of Oquilla’s Eye to receive your loot.You will be able to acquire items to upgrade your ships and valuable treasures of the Great Ocean.In particular, you can receive Khan’s Concentrated Magic, which can be used to craft any of the three types of Khan’s Heart, one of the most powerful alchemy stones available!






Puturum flies through the sky and attacks Adventurers, being untargetable when in the air.

A common strategy used against this guild boss is to move to its back and attack whenever it spreads its wings.

Additionally, Hystria power towers will appear during the encounter. These towers must be destroyed as quickly as possible, because if not, after a while Puturum will use a large area of effect attack that not even Adventurers with some of the best equipment available can survive.

Among its rewards, you can obtain Belongings of an Ancient Guardian, which contains an accessory enhanced up to DUO (II) according to a set probability.



Ferrid is summoned at the Omar Lava Cave, in central Mediah. Its summon boss scroll pieces can be obtained by completing boss subjugation requests from the territory of Mediah.



Its attack patterns include an area stun, ranged knockdowns, and the ability to summon lava monsters. To defeat Ferrid, it is recommended to attack its back, due to Ferrid being able to stun you if you attack it from the front.Beware of the lava monsters summoned after Ferrid punches the ground, as they may overwhelm inexperienced guild members the first time they face this enemy. Due to this, make sure to destroy the lava swamps that summon them as quickly as possible.

Upon defeating Ferrid, you may obtain the item Energy of All Creations, which is employed to craft  Breath of All Creations, a useful buff for Node/Conquest Wars, as well as Stone of Malice, used to craft the sought after Magic Crystal of Infinity - Skill.



The Giant Mudster is summoned at Glish Ruins, in southern Serendia. Its summon boss scroll pieces can be obtained by completing boss subjugation requests from the territory of Serendia that do not require defeating monsters in the same region.



The Giant Mudster is slow, but its attacks are powerful and affect a wide area, slowing the movement and attack speed of all Adventurers in range. Be careful to not be hit too much!

If you see it scattering mud around, it’s a signal that it’s summoning smaller mudsters. These monsters will explode after some time, so it’s advised to kill them quickly or avoid the area they’re in.

One of the most powerful attacks the Giant Mudster can do is when it compresses itself and thorns rise from the ground, dealing great damage to all those hit by them.

Upon defeating the Giant Mudster, like with Ferrid, you can obtain both Energy of All Creations and Stone of Malice.



You can exchange 20 essences of fury at the various guild managers in cities for Operation Orders from Kamasylvia x1, a request from the Lemoria Guard in Kamasylvia to help deal with the hostile Ahib Griffon terrorizing the Navarn Steppe.When you have this item, go meet NPC Liudia, located at the northern border of the steppe. Liudia will exchange the operation orders for one of two boss summon scrolls. As with Muskan’s case, you have two options to choose from, the normal or awakened boss, which will alter the encounter’s difficulty.Please be aware these scrolls expire 3 days after obtaining them, after which they’ll be unusable.

Once you have the chosen summon scroll, head to the summoning location. There, the guild master or an officer can summon the boss.

Subtópico: Music Album, Compose & Play

For Adventurers unfamiliar with the Compose & Play system, this page will explain its basic functions and how to compose music using the system.

Don’t we all have a Beethoven inside of us just waiting to break free?

Shall we begin~?

Quite a few options, aren’t there? Let’s go over each one together!
In particular, you can use your mouse to drag over and select several notes to edit them all at once in Select Mode.

Here’s an example.You’ve toiled really hard to compose your song, yet after listening to it, you feel it a bit too high and want to lower an octave.You wouldn’t want to go back and input each note all over again, right?Select all of the notes you wish to change, for you can move them or edit all of the selected notes at once.

It’d be a waste to listen to such a masterpiece all by yourself!Why not share it with other adventurers?



You can play your music by pressing Play on a Shai that has discovered her Talent.



There may be Adventurers who wish to compose even longer masterpieces.By completing certain quests, you can increase your music level, which will expand the number of measures and notes you can compose with.

There are a total of 8 florchestra instruments, and out of the 8, 5 are upgraded versions of the old beginner instruments while 3 are completely new instruments that were not part of the beginner instruments.

Florchestra instruments boast a more exquisite exterior than the old beginner instruments, and their sounds can be modulated through a processor called an effector.



An effector is a device that affects sound in some way to change what you hear. For example, the Echo and Reverb knobs of a karaoke machine, which change the sound of your voice to be “richer” and “fuller” when you turn it on, are known as effectors.

While effectors can be categorized in several different ways, Florchestra’s effectors are primarily categorized into two systems: spatial and modulation.

For instance, applying a “spatial” effector transforms the sound to give it a sense of space, such as a room, music hall, etc. On the other hand, a modulator can change the tone of the sound to be deeper, stranger, etc.

The Florchestra Effectors can only be utilized with Florchestra instruments. These effectors can be attached to compositions and will be used alongside the Florchestra instruments.

You can adjust the effector as you compose a song, and the settings of the effector are saved with the song rather than each instrument. As this is meant to be an easier-to-understand concept, you can’t adjust the effector directly from your Florchestra instrument. To put it simply, you can understand the Florchestra Instrument as an instrument that can be influenced by an effector rather than played with an effector.

Since effectors consume a lot of the Black Spirit’s energy (in other words, it uses a lot of your PC’s CPU), they can’t be unlimited in how they’re used and must be used as efficiently as possible. So, they’ve been set up this way. Due to the limitations of this method, if you’re playing a song with effectors, but another group is playing another song next to you, you’ll hear their sound with the adjustments of the effectors in the song you are playing. Unfortunately, there is no other way to save the Black Spirit’s energy.


You can adjust the amount of sounds transferred from your instrument to the effector by using AuxSend from the Florchestra Instruments category. When it lights up, it means that the sounds are being transferred to the effector.



You can adjust the settings for the musical technique on the upper right of the Compose window. Musical techniques refer to ways of playing music, and they differ for each different type of instrument.



Keep the following in mind.


◈ How to Obtain
The method to obtain these newly released Florchestra instruments with their brilliant tones, musical techniques, and effector, is different from beginner instruments that you can get directly from a shop with silver. You can slowly obtain the ingredients required for the upgraded versions of the beginner instruments over 10 days via daily quests.

First, you can purchase blueprints for Florchestra instruments at Lake Kaia, Lake Flondor, Salanar Pond, and Artina's Instrument Shop in Ancado Inner Harbor.

After that, right-clicking on an instrument blueprint will navigate you to an Artina NPC of an Instrument Shop for the blessings of young spirits (dewdrops) required to craft an instrument.

Remember that you can only accept these quests when you have the respective instrument's blueprint in your inventory, and that they are daily quests.

Finally, you can craft Florchestra's instruments through the Processing window (hotkey: L) using the blessing of young spirits obtained through the aforementioned quests.

Alternatively, you can also craft them with the following materials:

Subtópico: Yar!
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
Yar! is a minigame where you draw cards and commit to certain hands to earn a number of points. You win if you have a higher total score than your opponent.You can draw a hand of five cards. You can either choose to keep the cards or draw them again.

Yar!’s appeal comes from strategically considering which cards to keep or redraw and which hand to commit points to in order to achieve the best score possible.The number of times you can draw, and the hands you can score, may differ depending on the level of difficulty.


Yar! is an easy and simple minigame for any Adventurer to enjoy with friends, guild members, other Adventurers they come across, and even the inhabitants of the world of Black Desert.

Yar! is a game where you face off against an opponent by drawing cards a set number of times in turns. You can win if the total combined score of all your committed hands exceeds your opponent’s. Each hand has requirements that need to be met in order to qualify for points. The rules are easy, and you'll find yourself quickly engrossed after just a few rounds.

You can use the Yar! Invite feature to conveniently play Yar! with a faraway Adventurer when traveling long distances or while out at sea.

If you don’t want to challenge other Adventurers, you can challenge certain local NPCsto a game of Yar!.

Yar! was popularized by a Shai girl named Yar who suddenly appeared in Velia one day.

The "Yar!" deck consists of cards with symbols of a sun, moon, star, and flower as well as numbers 1(A) to 6.


Select your game mode, then enter the family name of your opponent to send an invite. You can view the hands to be scored for each mode from the "Hands" screen.

You must select a game mode before sending an invite, as that will determine the types of hands available, as well as the number of times you can draw cards.

Select “Hands” after choosing your game mode to see the list of hands available for that specific mode.

In Yar!, each player takes turns drawing cards and you can score points for different hands.

The player, on their turn, can redraw any number of their cards a set number of times. You can draw up to 5 cards and choose whether to keep some of them or just redraw the whole hand.

Cards that were selected to be kept can be unselected before choosing to redraw.

The cards you select to keep will remain even when you redraw new cards for that turn.

You commit to a hand by selecting one of the named hands listed on the left side of the Yar! window at any time during your turn.

You must commit to a specific hand to earn points for it at the end of your turn. If time expires before you make your selection, points will be committed to a random available hand.
You can score points by selecting the gray numbers that appear beside each listed hand. Points will be allocated randomly to one of the remaining hands if you run out of time.

You cannot commit to a hand that has already been scored or change a hand's score once the points have been allocated. In following rounds, you may only select hands that have not yet been scored.

You can also voluntarily select a hand to be scored for 0 points.

Below is a list of Yar! hands.

The types of hands and number of redraws may differ depending on the game mode you choose.


Your score depends on the cards you've drawn for each hand. Some hands will give you a set score regardless of the cards you've drawn, as long as you meet the requirements.

For example, if you have a hand of A/A/A/2/2, you would gain 3 points if you select “Bit o’ Ones” since you have three As, but you’d get 4 points if you select “Bunch o’ Twos” since you have two 2s. However, this hand also meets the requirement for Den of Wolves, which could be selected for a flat 25 points.

Yar!’s appeal comes from the emergent strategy born from considering which cards to redraw or keep by looking at the hands you've scored and what hands you have remaining.

Magic Crystals are usually obtained by defeating monsters. However, the types you can obtain differ for each monster zone. So, try looking in the Central Market for the magical crystals with the desired effects.


▲ You can purchase a wide variety of magical crystals from the Central Market.

Check out the “Magic Crystals” guide for details about magical crystals.

2. Skill Add-ons
Skill add-ons are additional effects that can be added on to certain skills. The additional effects activated when you hit targets with the skill. These additional effects can be added through the Skill Instructor NPCs after your character reaches lv. 50.
Each time your character reaches lv. 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, and 60, they get a skill add-on for a single skill. Meaning, you can have skill add-ons for a total of 6 skills.


▲ You can get skill add-ons through Skill Instructor NPCs found in major cities and towns.

If you happen to be far from any city or town, try going to the Battle Arena and talking to the skill instructor Tachros. You can enter the Battle Arena at any time as long as your character has full HP by opening the ESC menu > War.

▲ You can adjust your skill add-ons easily by entering the Battle Arena then talking to the skill instructor, Tachros.

Check out the “Skill Add-ons" guide for details about skill add-ons.

3. Buffs
All effects that positively affect a character are known as “buffs.”
And, in the world of Black Desert, there are a large array of buffs to choose from.

Buffs that improve your combat stats are especially great for increasing your combat efficiency.
However, not all buffs can stack with each other. So, you will need to select buffs that can be used in conjunction with one another.


▲ Current buffs applied to your character are displayed on the Buff bar.

Focus on obtaining combat buffs.
The table below lists commonly used buffs that stack together. They are listed in the order of priority.

※ Buff duration of buffs that are applied to only your character will stop to countdown the character logs out of the game. The buff duration will then continue once you log back in with the character.
Tip
1. Food and draughts take a lot of materials and multiple steps to make. However, they can be easily purchased from the Central Market as other Adventurers tend to sell them. Alchemy stones can also be purchased from the Central Market. However, depending on which stone you are aiming to obtain, their effects and price may vary significantly.
2. Campsite buffs can be purchased through a campsite. For details about campsite, check out the “Campsite” guide.
3. Gold Bar buffs can be exchanged for Gold Bar 10G x3 (worth around 3,000,000 Silver) at major cities and towns through an NPC. However, it isn’t the most efficient buff as traveling from the NPC to your desired monster zone takes time.

4. Others
Just getting your skill add-ons, magical crystals, and buffs is enough to get you started, however, there are other ways to improve your character’s combat capabilities.
Check out the “Useful Tips – Raising Combat Stats” guide for more details.

If you are trying to reach lv. 61 or even higher, it will be extremely beneficial for you to know about the various Combat EXP buffs.
By the way, Combat EXP and Skill EXP are their own separate systems in Black Desert. So, it will be best for you to get both types of buffs.

※ Combat EXP buffs are calculated by adding them all together.

1. Combat & Skill EXP 530% Scroll (60 min)
There are a large variety of EXP buffs, however, it may be difficult for Adventurers that are just stepping into the world of Black Desert to get every type of buff available.
Still, the Combat & Skill EXP 530% Scroll (60 min) can be purchased via the Pearl Shop with Silver. So, be sure to get them!


▲ You can purchase 1 of these via the Pearl Shop for very little “Loyalties.”

The Combat & Skill EXP 530% Scroll gives exactly what its name implies, 530% increase to Combat and Skill EXP gained.
You can use this item to level up quickly, but you can only get 53 of them per Family. So, be sure to use them wisely!
However, there could be occasional special events in the future that allows you to purchase more of them.

2. Sealed Book of Combat
Using the Sealed Book of Combat does not get consumed but continues to give you a +100% EXP buff every time you use it during its period.
New Adventurers can obtain this item from their Challenges and login rewards. When you get one in your Inventory, you need to right-click on it to be able to use it. When you right-click on it for the first time, you will be shown a message asking if you really want to use the item.


▲ Opening a Sealed Book of Combat.
Press “Yes (Enter)”, then the duration of the Book of Combat will start to count down. You can keep using the item during the period.

3. Blessed Message Scroll
Blessed Message Scroll is an item that gives Combat EXP +200% and Skill EXP +30% for 100 minutes.
New Adventurers can obtain this item from their Challenges and login rewards. They are also given out as part of events and other means.


▲ Blessed Message Scroll

4. Others
There are more ways to get Combat and Skill EXP buffs in the world of Black Desert.

There is food like the Simple Cron Meal that increases EXP gain and combat stats. You could also use Beast's Draught and other items that give important buffs as well.
There is also the Black Spirit’s buff that you can obtain by consuming Energy.


▲ Open the Black Spirit menu > Exchange then select an option to consume Energy for an EXP buff.

If you would like to find out more about EXP buffs, check out the various guides written by veteran Adventurers.


Subtópico: Bosses
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
The world of Black Desert presents a wide variety of encounters. Among them, the possibility of battling against beings that are deemed, for one reason or another, bosses.

What is a boss? A monster enemy that, be it in status or power, stands above all others. Some are the leaders of their tribe or group. Others have obtained immense power at the expense of delving into the mysteries of the black stone. There are also those that are naturally just powerful by themselves, like dragons.

Regardless of their origin, when one defeats a boss they can expect a valuable reward that corresponds to the effort required. Some drop materials for enhancement, like black stones, while others may drop a unique item to them, like a boss equipment piece.

The various types of boss encounters are diverse. They are explained below.


◈ Main Quest
During the main quest you will travel across the world, uncovering mysteries that were buried long ago. During your journey, you will inevitably come into conflict with those that possess power, either because you’ve been asked to assist the local inhabitants of a settlement, or perhaps because the encounter might help you on your current objective.

Many of the bosses later encountered in other modalities of content are first seen during the main quest, where it is explained who they are, and what they’re doing.

Do not worry about the difficulty of these battles, as they’re adjusted to the equipment you can naturally obtain as you progress through the story.


▲ Red Nose, the Imp Boss, is the first boss encounter you’ll face in the main quest.


◈ World Bosses
These are beings that threaten an entire territory’s peace and stability with their mere presence. Examples are Kzarka, the Lord of Corruption, an ancient deity being summoned by cultists in Serendia Shrine, and Garmoth, the Crimson Dragon, a dragon that wants to enact revenge against those that wronged her a hundred years ago.

They all appear in fixed locations throughout the world, and at specific times of the day.A system-wide message will warn you about their appearance 15 minutes in advance, in case your character needs to travel to the location.Their health points (HP) are shared across all servers in a region, and many adventurers are required to defeat them.If they have not been defeated in 30 minutes after first appearing, they will disappear.

There are three exceptions to the way all world bosses work.- Quint and Muraka will disappear 15 minutes after first appearing.- Vell’s system warning will be given 30 minutes in advance, not 15 minutes, as the distance required to travel to the boss’ location is noticeably longer than that of other encounters.

Keep in mind that some of them might even have an empowered form that will appear in place of the normal iteration of the boss. For example, instead of Kzarka, the one that appears might be Nightmarish Kzarka. These empowered forms are a threat to even the best equipped Adventurers.

Alongside enhancement materials and magic crystals, one can obtain their unique boss equipment pieces as loot, like a Kzarka main weapon, or Garmoth’s Heart, an item required to create a powerful alchemy stone.

► Please check the [World Bosses] page for more information about them.
▲ Kzarka was Black Desert’s first world boss, and has always remained a popular one among Adventurers ever since.


◈ Field Bosses
While not as strong as world bosses, field bosses are considered a regional threat to the area they appear in, and thus Adventurers are tasked to deal with them whenever possible.Examples are Red Nose, the Imp Boss, and Black Shadow, the young dragon.

They all appear in fixed locations throughout the world, but not at specific scheduled times.Field bosses appear in random servers, and on average once a day.That means a field boss might appear in the server Serendia 1, but maybe not in Calpheon 2.

The only exception to the rule is Black Shadow. Its initial spawn location and time are fixed, and it will appear once per week.

In addition to enhancement materials, magic crystals, and enchanted scrolls, some of the field bosses possess unique boss equipment pieces they can drop when defeated, such as Bheg’s Gloves and Dim Tree Spirit’s Armor.

► Please check the [Field Bosses] page for further information on each field boss, their location, loot, and particularities.


◈ Guild Bosses
These are encounters to tackle together with your fellow guild members. From time to time the villagers ask for assistance against monsters assailing them. This is no different, but on a grander scale.Together with other members of your guild you are able to battle against certain bosses: Khan, Ancient Puturum, Ferrid, and the Giant Mudster.

These bosses can be summoned at their fixed locations by the guild master, advisor, or officers, with summon scrolls. These are crafted by obtaining summon scroll pieces by completing guild boss subjugation missions.

All guild bosses will disappear 30 minutes after being first summoned, and while Khan will remain for the entire 30 minutes regardless of being attacked or not, the other bosses will vanish if left idle for 2 minutes.

Keep in mind that guild bosses cannot be attacked if the server you’re in has a node or conquest war in progress.

Their loot includes enhancement materials, lightstones, Marni’s Unstable Fuel, and more, with minor variations among most of them, and major variations for Khan.


▲ Through the Guild Boss Subjugation tab of the Guild window you can keep track of the guild boss encounters available and their status.

► Please check the [Guild Bosses] page for more information about this type of encounter.


◈ Dark Rifts
Once your character reaches Lv. 56, several dark rifts will open throughout Black Desert’s world.Defeat the bosses that appear from them to obtain rare items. Note that the Dark Rift feature is individual to each Adventurer, and thus you have to defeat these bosses alone. You cannot team up with other Adventurers to face them, as the bosses won’t appear to them.

There is no penalty for falling in battle against these bosses. If you attempt to battle them again, the boss's HP consumed in the previous battle is maintained, which will allow you to defeat it even over multiple attempts.

After defeating a boss, the dark rift that brought it will disappear, and after a variable amount of time has elapsed it will reappear.The rifts do not reappear at a set rate, but they will reopen no later than ten days after a boss has been defeated.

The loot reward for defeating these bosses include items such as the Box of the Dead, Remnants of the Rift, and PEN (V) Boss Gear quest chain materials. Bosses that don’t drop Boxes of the Dead will instead drop a large amount of Ancient Spirit Dust, a material needed to synthesize Caphras Stones.


▲ When you approach the area marked on the World Map with the Dark Rift symbol a system message will appear warning you of the boss’ appearance.

► Please check the page [Dark Rifts] for more information about this feature.


◈ Faded Ancient Relic Summon Scrolls
As you travel throughout the world you will come across certain items that can be put together to form summon scrolls. For example, x5 Ancient Relic Crystal Shard will create an Ancient Relic Crystal Summon Scroll, while x5 Venomous Night Fang will create an Ibedor's Scroll.Some of the pieces for these scrolls can be obtained by defeating monsters in certain areas, while others can be obtained while fishing.

At specific locations in the world you can use the obtained summon scrolls to call forth bosses and their minions.You will see each of these specific locations always have a device known as the Faded Ancient Relic nearby. By using these devices, one can pool together a greater number of scrolls to be employed all at once, which will result in the summoned monsters being more powerful, but also giving better rewards.

The scrolls that can be used with this feature are: Ancient Relic Crystal Summon Scroll, Pila Fe Scroll, Manshaum Narc's Stone, and Ibedor’s Scroll.

There's no penalty for death while fighting these encounters, but depending on the type of scroll you might be able, and even will be recommended, to team up with other Adventurers to make the encounters more easily overcome. With the Faded Ancient Relic feature the party members can add their own scrolls as well to level up the difficulty of the encounter, and the amount of rewards obtained, up to 5 stages.

Note that depending on the summon scroll details may vary on the way they work.


▲ Example of the Faded Ancient Relic UI with an Ibedor’s Scroll, ready for activation.


◈ Black Spirit Summon Scrolls
As you advance through the main quest, you will notice the black spirit has new quests, often referred to as [Special], in the Recurring tab of the Quests section. These are unlocked the more you progress in the main quest, and give you access to receiving summon scrolls and summon scroll pieces to battle against bosses for daily and weekly rewards.


▲ The black spirit will offer you a list of summon scroll quests to choose from.

First, the black spirit will give you a quest asking you to defeat certain enemies in a location. Once this quest is completed, depending on the type of summon scroll it is, the black spirit will offer you a daily or weekly quest. The rewarded summon scroll from this quest can be used in a specific location to summon its corresponding boss.

Once the boss is defeated, you can obtain its loot, often enhancement materials such as black stones, magic crystals, materials for the PEN (V) Boss Gear quest chains, and very rarely even their unique boss equipment piece, if they are one of the bosses that possess one.

These quests are categorized from I to VII, and can be (1/D) or (1/W), which means they can be completed once per day or once per week. If you have more than one quest called [Special V] available, you can only complete one of them. Once the cooldown period has passed, the black spirit will offer all the ones of that category again.

You will notice some of these quests give you the choice of obtaining a normal summon scroll, for example Goblin Chief Summon Scroll, or a scroll piece, such as Awakened Giath Summon Scroll Piece. By gathering scroll pieces and fusing them, you can create awakened summon scrolls, like Awakened Goblin Chief Summon Scroll. The bosses summoned with awakened scrolls are more powerful than their normal iteration, and have a higher chance of giving you better loot.


▲ You can choose between an easier encounter, or an awakened one.


◈ Rift Echoes
Rift Echos are a feature meant to be a way to obtain season enhancement materials, and as such are only available in season servers.

What is a Rift’s Echo? An item usable from Lv. 50 that is said to open a rift that calls forth various monsters, including bosses like Red Nose, Dastard Bheg, Saunil Siege Captain, and Kavali. If you defeat the monsters that appear from the rift, you’ll be able to obtain season enhancement materials.

You will not be penalized for being defeated by the summoned monsters, but a party is strongly recommended because of the difficulty level. If you are in a party, only the party leader can use the Rift's Echo.

Keep in mind the boss will disappear after 2 minutes of idleness, or after 30 minutes of being summoned.

The rewards you can obtain include Time-filled Black Stones, Refined Magical Black Stones, Tuvala Ore, and Tuvala accessories.


▲ The Saunil Siege Captain is one of the bosses that appear from a Rift’s Echo!

There are currently 9 World Bosses in Black Desert’s world, and they appear in all servers except for the Olvia servers, Arsha PvP server, and Season Arsha PvP server.



◈ Schedule for When World Bosses Appear (In Black Desert’s World)





◈ World Boss Apparition Notification

▲ System messages announcing the appearance of the various World Bosses will appear at the top of your screen.

World Bosses appear in specific locations, so anyone can join the fight. However, it’s best to get your AP and DP high enough for you to have a chance to earn loot as well as withstand their attacks.

You may face a penalty for death if your character dies while fighting against a World Boss.

When a World Boss is defeated, many Adventurers are chosen to pick-up loot depending on the “amount of damage dealt.” Still, there’s no reason to stress too much about getting good gear. The “amount of damage dealt” is only one of the standards, so you can still have a chance to get the best loot items if you’re lucky.

World Bosses will automatically vanish if you don’t defeat them within 30 minutes. (For Quint/Muraka it is 15 minutes.)

You can partake in the World Boss Raids on almost any server, since the World Bosses share HP across all servers.



Kzarka, the Lord of Corruption, is relatively one of the easier world bosses to defeat.When Kzarka becomes immune to all attacks, it means it is preparing to unleash its fiery breath or a large area of effect (AoE) attack. When this happens, you must hide behind a column to minimize the amount of damage dealt.If it’s your first time, you should carefully observe the movement of other Adventurers. When other Adventurers step back, you should follow their movements to evade Kzarka’s powerful attack pattern.

You have a chance of obtaining a Kzarka's Sealed Weapon Box as loot after he is defeated.
Should you obtain it, right-click on the weapon box to get a Kzarka main weapon for your class.

◈ Nightmarish Kzarka


When Kzarka is scheduled to appear, “Nightmarish Kzarka” may appear instead.You should be well-prepared for battle to survive Nightmarish Kzarka’s sudden appearance.

You can easily be defeated by Nightmarish Kzarka, as he is much more powerful than the pre-existing world boss and has a variety of attack patterns.

The benefit to fighting his Nightmarish form is that you can obtain much more valuable loot, including a Kzarka Weapon Box containing Kzarka main weapons that are enhanced up to TET (IV).





You’ll need Purified Water and Star Anise Tea to fight off desert illnesses since Nouver appears in the desert.
During the encounter, you should be ready to quickly move away from Nouver to avoid getting sucked into his whirlwinds. Also, remember to evade to the side when he tilts its head back, signaling that it’s preparing to use his fire breath. This attack deals high damage to any target caught in its path. Nouver also uses powerful skills while airborne, so be prepared to use invincibility, evasion, and blocking skills to survive the powerful boss’ attacks. Move away from other Adventurers to prepare for an AoE attack when Nouver is airborne.

You can obtain a Nouver’s Sealed Sub-weapon Box if you are lucky.Right-click Nouver’s Sealed Sub-weapon Box to obtain a Nouver sub-weapon for your class.

◈ Bloodstorm Nouver


When Nouver is scheduled to appear, “Bloodstorm Nouver” may appear instead. You should take precautions when encountering this boss, as it is much more powerful than the regular Nouver, with new attack patterns such as creating AoE whirlwinds and illusions.

When you defeat Bloodstorm Nouver you can obtain much more valuable loot, including a sub-weapon box containing Nouver sub-weapons enhanced up to TET (IV).


➤ Check out [Learning About World Bosses Part. II – Nouver, Master of the Sandstorm] for more info!



You can only encounter Karanda in Karanda Ridge, in Calpheon. This World Boss alone is quite strong and has a variety of attack patterns. Additionally, the terrain roughness and limited space of the ridge makes the encounter against the Harpy Queen even more perilous. There are two skills to take note of:
The first skill is an AoE attack in which she suddenly flies up into the sky and attacks a large area outside of the circle around her. To avoid this attack, you must quickly get within her circle. The second skill is an attack pattern in which she lands for a short moment then takes off again.This AoE attack deals damage within the circle around her, so it is important to quickly move outside the circle to avoid it. You can obtain a Dandelion Weapon Box if you’re lucky. Right-click the weapon box to obtain a Dandelion Awakening weapon for your class.

◈ Stormbringer Karanda

When Karanda is scheduled to appear, “Stormbringer Karanda” may appear instead.
You have to brace yourself for the powerful whirlwinds she creates upon appearing.

You must be especially careful, since the enhanced attack pattern of this World Boss lets her throw you into the distance far below the mountains, which may deal high, if not fatal, damage.

When you defeat Stormbringer Karanda, you can obtain much more valuable loot, including the “Heart of Karanda”, which when infused to an Awakening weapon adds the effect Critical Hit Rate +3% and a crystal slot to it, and a weapon box containing a Dandelion Awakening Weapon that is enhanced up to TET (IV).


➤ Check out [Learning About World Bosses Part III – Karanda, Slayer of the Skies] for more info!




Kutum takes the form of a worm and moves its body from side to side when it attacks. It also has powerful skill effects that allow it to suck in everything in range.

It makes a ranged attack that spits out dirt to stun its targets, and it also jumps at a particular target after it digs into the ground.
You should always be careful, since the boss sends out electric currents once its HP reaches 50% or below.
Make sure to avoid the storm of dust that forms when it emerges from the ground.

You can obtain a Kutum's Sealed Sub-weapon Box if you’re lucky.
Right-click the Kutum Sub-weapon Box to obtain a Kutum sub-weapon for your class.
Kutum sub-weapons are popular amongst Adventurers as they balance both AP and DP, whereas Nouver sub-weapons focus more on AP.

◈ Thundercloud Kutum

When Kutum is scheduled to appear, “Thundercloud Kutum” may appear instead.It has powerful skills and employs a wide variety of attack patterns, and in addition creates thunder clouds during the encounter. Consider these clouds a puzzle. If you’re affected by them, you will notice a debuff that gradually drains your HP. To a side of the room you will find two stone chambers. Simply enter the stone chamber that is of the same color as the clouds to clear them away.

Be wary of Thundercloud Kutum once its HP drops below a certain amount, as it will start to use powerful skills, like summoning ancient weapons.


When you defeat Thundercloud Kutum, you can obtain “Kutum’s Power Stone”, which is equipped in the Alchemy Stone slot. It enables you to deal damage to monsters and debuff DP of your enemies, but keep in mind that this power stone cannot be recharged. You can also obtain much more valuable loot, including the “Heart of Kutum”. which when infused into a sub-weapon adds the effect Special Attack Evasion Rate +7%, and a weapon box containing a Kutum sub-weapon that is enhanced up to TET(IV).


▲ Quint is bigger than a regular troll.

You can see a giant troll statue when you go to Quint Hill in Northern Calpheon. This is Quint, also known as the first troll.

When a system message appears, Quint will start jumping all over the place as he escapes his petrificated form.

Quint is relatively slow, which means it is possible to evade its attacks if you really focus on the fight. However, do not rely too much on HP potions and take a direct hit from him if you want to survive the encounter. Quint’s attack speed and AP increases as his HP decreases, so be sure to keep your focus throughout the fight. That said, there’s no need for you to be afraid. Even if your character dies during the encounter against Quint, you will not lose EXP or have your magic crystals broken.

◈ Location of Quint


▲ Quint Hill, Northern Calpheon


▲ The King of Ogres, Muraka is covered with black crystallized scales. He is bigger than a regular ogre.

Muraka, a giant ogre, is covered with black crystallized scales. He is bigger than a regular ogre. The threatening presence Muraka gives off has earned him the title King of Ogres.Muraka appears deep within the Mansha Forest, where the Mansha goblin tribe and other ogres reside, but do not make the mistake of equating them to him. Muraka is slow like Quint and relatively easy to dodge. However, do not underestimate the powerful AoE attacks of Muraka, or else you’ll drop flat on the cold, forest floor. Keep in mind that as Muraka’s HP drops, his attack speed and AP increases.Once his HP gets low, your character can be killed instantly when Muraka uses the attack where he strikes the ground with his fist, even if you have a set of TET (IV) defense gear. Still, like with Quint, you will not lose EXP or have your magic crystals broken even if your character dies during the encounter. So, why don’t you go for the challenge?You can deal damage to make Muraka fall on its knees by continuously attacking its legs, since it’s gigantic like Quint.

◈ Location of Muraka





Mirumok Destroyer Offin appears deep in the Holo Forest of Kamasylvia. You’ll need to be well-prepared to fight this world boss, as it is one of the toughest ones to defeat. Offin is a world boss that repeatedly transforms and combines. The large, tree-like entity is the Mirumok Destroyer Offin, and the one riding it from within is Watcher Offin Tett. Offin has four legs and a gigantic body, whereas Offin Tett is mounted and resides within. You can only attack Offin’s legs at the start of the encounter. Offin Tett will come out for the first time once a certain amount of damage is dealt to Offin’s legs. Offin stops functioning once Offin Tett comes out, but it doesn’t mean the fight gets any easier. Offin Tett creates multiple clones and uses powerful attacks, so don’t let your guard down.When Offin Tett loses a certain amount of HP, it gets back inside Offin to continue the fight. When you defeat Offin, you can obtain Offin Tett’s Light Sealed Weapon Box if you’re lucky.You can get an Offin Tett’s Radiant main weapon for your class when you open the box.Offin Tett’s Radiant weapons have lower accuracy, but higher AP compared to Kzarka main weapons.



The Crimson Dragon, Garmoth, appears at Garmoth’s Nest in central Drieghan.

She is much more powerful than the iteration you defeat as part of the Drieghan main questline, so it’s a good idea to be well-prepared before taking on this challenge. Garmoth is a dragon just like Nouver, but the main difference between the two is Garmoth’s AoE attacks. Watch out for the Crimson Dragon’s AoE attacks, as depending on the amount of magic she has absorbed, they may prove fatal should you approach them without enough preparation.  When you defeat Garmoth, you can obtain “Garmoth’s Heart” if you’re lucky.Garmoth’s Heart, like the Heart of Karanda, is used to upgrade certain weapons. In this case, not only Awakening weapons, but also Kutum and Nouver sub-weapons can be upgraded with it. Upgraded Awakening weapons will receive 2 magic crystal slots and the Critical Hit Damage +3% effect, while upgraded sub-weapons will receive the following effects: Max HP +150, Max Stamina +100, and Special Attack Evasion Rate +10%.However, to upgrade weapons with Garmoth’s Heart you will first need to transform it into an Inverted Heart of Garmoth via a quest.




▲ Vell, the Heart of the Ocean, appears deep within Margoria, in the appropriately called Vell’s Realm area.

While the system will notify you of other World Bosses appearing 15 minutes before it happens, you will see a system message on the screen that lets you know when Vell will appear 30 minutes in advance. This is due to the long distance that needs to be traveled to reach the area.
At the start, a whirlpool will form before Vell’s appearance. If you get swept into the whirlpool, you and your ship can take tons of damage. Also make sure to approach Vell carefully, since it can deal a lot of damage to Adventurers in the area when it first appears, enraged and attempting to escape from the seal trapping it. When the fight begins, Vell uses her fragments, “Lopters”, and tries to destroy ships that fire cannons at her. The approaching Lopters can be defeated by firing hunting matchlocks. Vell can only take damage from ship cannon fire. Vell retaliates from time to time with powerful breath attacks, so be sure to stay on the move if you’re in the breath’s path. When you fight Vell, every member of the same party or platoon is granted the same amount of Combat EXP, even when another member uses the Focus Fire skill.
Everyone should just try their best in each of their positions, whether you’re an Adventurer steering the ship, defeating incoming Lopters, repairing the ship, out scouting, or firing cannons. You will not receive a death penalty even if your character dies during your fight against Vell.
If you choose to resurrect at the closest town, you’ll resurrect at Oquilla's Eye.
If you choose to resurrect at a node, you’ll resurrect on the ocean (at a slight distance away from the area where the fight against Vell takes place). When you resurrect at the node, wait for other Adventurers to come rescue you, as there are buoys nearby. Once Vell takes a certain amount of damage, it will enrage and unleash a devastating AoE attack. When this happens, every Adventurer on the surface of the water will die from a big tsunami. You can avoid the incoming wave by either firmly holding onto the ship or diving underwater. You can obtain your reward for defeating Vell through the Black Spirit’s Safe.
When you defeat Vell, you can obtain “Vell’s Heart” if you’re lucky, a rechargeable offensive alchemy stone. If you obtain Vell’s Concentrated Magic, you can process it via Simple Alchemy with x1,500 Alchemy Stone Shards to obtain a Vell’s Heart.

Subtópico: Field Bosses
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
You can encounter a variety of different bosses in the world of Black Desert.There are for example bosses you can summon with scrolls, and bosses that appear by themselves and can only be defeated when a large number of Adventurers work together.Field bosses belong to this second category. Field bosses will occasionally appear in specific locations and threaten their vicinity.In the seamless world of Black Desert anyone can participate in these encounters against field bosses, and enjoy the game to its full extent. Field bosses have significantly higher AP and HP compared to regular field monsters, so beware that if you come unprepared and your character dies, you will lose EXP and there’s always the possibility of your infused magic crystals being shattered.Still, many Adventurers go out to battle them, as they can drop exclusive rare loot which makes the encounters worth the challenge.You still have a chance to obtain the rare items dropped from field bosses even if you are not in a party, so don’t be afraid to participate in the encounters alone.

You may have already encountered some of the field bosses during the main quest, or have summoned them with a scroll given to you by the black spirit. However, the ones that appear as field bosses are much stronger compared to the other iterations you’ve previously encountered, so don’t take them lightly.

It is important to know that field bosses appear in random servers, and on average once a day (excluding Black Shadow).
Groups of field bosses will appear together. For example, once Dastard Bheg has appeared in the Balenos Forest and been defeated, Red Nose will appear in the Agris Steppe to wreak havoc. After this one has been dealt with, Dim Tree Spirit will unleash its fury in the Forest of Seclusion. Each one will appear 3 minutes after vanquishing the previous one.
The same occurs with the Giant Mudster in Serendia and Katzvariak in Drieghan. Once the first one has been stopped, after 5 minutes the second one will appear.
If a field boss appears, a system message will appear only on the server it has spawned.Coordinate with other Adventurers to find out whenever a field boss appears, move to its spawn location, and partake in the encounter.
All field bosses except for Black Shadow will disappear 1 hour after they’ve made their presence known.



Dastard Bheg assaults his foes by swinging his giant hook all over the area, but its movement is slow. So whether you’re his main target or not, be sure to move out of his way if you ever find yourself facing him head on.
The boss of the altar imps has another attack where his body glows red before he swings his hook twice in a wide area of effect (AoE) attack that deals high damage.
Like Red Nose, Dastard Bheg also becomes enraged and performs a special AoE attack once his HP drops to a certain percentage. He will swing his hook around himself, dealing high damage several times. Unlike his pre-enraged state, he will perform this attack more than twice, so don’t jump in after his second attack ends, or it could cost your character their life.


◈ Where Can Dastard Bheg Be Found?

Within Balenos Forest, south of the town of Velia, in the territory of Balenos.







The Imp Boss performs a variety of melee attacks with his cleaver and a charging attack. If you’re not the main target, move behind it to continue dealing constant damage to the boss without taking damage yourself.

Once his HP drops below a certain percentage he will become enraged. While enraged, he performs powerful shockwave attacks, so you should watch out for when it unleashes them, or stay far from the boss.

Another enraged mechanic you should watch out for is when Red Nose inhales. That’s your cue to disengage as it means Red Nose will perform a series of special area of effect attacks.This takes the form of two shockwave attacks followed by a devastating body slam attack.These series of attacks deal a lot of damage and might even kill your character, even if their DP is high.


◈ Where Can Red Nose Be Found?

North of Western Guard Camp, west of the town of Velia, in the territory of Balenos.







Don’t be fooled by the name and appearance of the Dim Tree Spirit, as it is anything but dim. It is a very agile and powerful field boss.Its attack patterns are simple slams and swings, but you have to watch out for them, as they’re swift, can knock you down, and cause you to take multiple hits. The Dim Tree Spirit has a special ranged attack, so Adventurers with ranged characters will need to pay special attention when the spirit starts to glow red. The glow indicates that it is charging up. After it has finished charging, the Dim Tree Spirit will throw rocks three times. This ranged attack is difficult to avoid and deals a lot of damage, so time your dodges carefully. The Dim Tree Spirit also has an attack where it hides underground to collect the energy of nature. When this happens, you must get away from it quickly, as it will perform a very wide AoE attack that will deal high damage.


◈ Where Can the Dim Tree Spirit Be Found?

Within the Forest of Seclusion, east of Bandit’s Den Byway, in the territory of Balenos.




Reminder: The field bosses in the territory of Balenos will appear one after another, 3 minutes after the previous one has been defeated. The order is Dastard Bheg, Red Nose, and Dim Tree Spirit.






The Giant Mudster is slow, but its AoE attack deals massive damage as well as reducing the movement and attack speed of every Adventurer that gets hit. The speed reduction debuff is fairly significant, so do your best to evade its attacks at all cost. Most of Giant Mudster’s big attacks begin when it shrinks down in size. If you see it shrink without any prior action or sign, quickly move out of the way. It will charge forward towards a target, dealing damage on the way.
If it shrinks while raining down mud around itself, then small mudsters will be summoned. These will need to be defeated, as otherwise they will explode and deal a high amount of damage to all Adventurers in the vicinity. Giant Mudster’s most powerful attack is when it shrinks after applying a stiffness debuff to nearby enemies. It follows up that debuff with a spike attack from the ground that deals high damage in a series of consecutive attacks. You'll have to either stay out of the attack’s radius or block them.

If you were hit by the initial attack that inflicted the stiffness debuff, you can use the skill “Emergency Escape” (hotkey: V) to evade the full attack.

When the Giant Mudster takes a significant amount of damage, it will flee to either the Southern Marsh node or to the northwest of the Glish Swamp node, and continue its rampage there.A message will appear on the upper part of the screen stating the whereabouts of the Giant Mudster. Watch for the message and go to the location to continue the encounter.


◈ Where Can the Giant Mudster Be Found?

It first appears in the Glish Ruins, in yellow. Locations where it runs off to, near the Southern Marsh node and northwest of the Glish Swamp node, in red. All three in the territory of Serendia.



Katzvariak, the leader of the kvariaks, appears on a hill overlooking the Tshira Ruins. It can move freely above and below ground, threatening adventurers with its powerful, poisonous attacks. Katzvariak covers areas of the ground with poison that deals damage to your characters. Make sure to stay away from them. Once it covers a total of 8 areas with poison, it will detonate them to inflict a huge amount of damage, so it’s a good idea to keep track of where these areas are and avoid them as much as possible.


◈ Where Can Katzvariak Be Found?

On a hill north of Tshira Ruins, west of the Forgotten Gateway, in the territory of Drieghan.

Reminder: The field bosses in the territories of Serendia and Drieghan will appear one after another, 5 minutes after the previous one has been defeated. The order in which they appear is Giant Mudster followed by Katzvariak.





The so-called Black Shadow usually flies above Saunil Battlefield,, and is believed to be the young dragon of Belmorn, he who possessed Jordine’s body during the main quest.

Once it starts flapping its wings in the sky, move well out of range or behind it to avoid being targeted by its breath attack.

Once the Black Shadow has taken critical damage, it will flee from the battle, leaving behind some loot, and will move to an area in the territories of Balenos, Serendia, and Calpheon. The area it goes to is not predetermined, and thus can go to different locations in the different servers it has spawned.

Since this field boss travels quite a long distance, having a fast horse ready is recommended to chase after it. Once it has taken critical damage three times, it will fly away into the distance and end the encounter.

While Black Shadow is a field boss, it appears in a different way compared to the other ones.Its initial spawn location and time are fixed, and it will appear once per week at the following times.


Do keep in mind that aside from its fixed spawn location and time, Black Shadow behaves like other field bosses, and as such it is possible it may not appear in the server you’re in. If this is the case, ask other Adventurers in chat to find out on which servers the young dragon has appeared, and chase after it!


◈ Where Can Black Shadow Be Found?

West of Marni Farm Ruins, east of Calpheon City, in the territory of Calpheon.



In the item drops list for most field bosses you will have seen their latent auras.

You can obtain a boss' respective equipment if you obtain at least 100 latent boss' auras and complete a family quest. For example, you can exchange x100 Bheg’s Latent Aura for x1 Bheg's Gloves.

Adventurers who have already exchanged the auras for boss equipment can exchange further auras of the same type for Memory Fragments.
You can find each quest of this type and its exchange location by right-clicking on the aura items.

You can also exchange 2 latent auras of a boss for x115 Concentrated Boss Crystal through Jetina's weekly quest. These crystals can be used for the guaranteed PEN (V) accessory questline.

The Innocence Mk XII will randomly deploy one of the three attack patterns.
- If you successfully disrupt the Innocence Mk XII, the boss will lose power and fall down. (This is your time to attack!)
- If you fail to disrupt the Innocence Mk XII, the boss will unleash a merciless, large-scale skill. (Losing HP from receiving damage will automatically cause the effects of the transformation scroll to wear off.)
┕ Even if the robot’s HP runs out and the transformation scroll loses its effects, you will still be able to obtain loot with your character, so no need to worry!



Winning in rock, paper, scissors against Innocence Mk XI will defeat Innocence Mk XI.
A loss or tie in rock, paper, scissors against Innocence Mk XI will result in an attack from Innocence Mk XI.

If several Adventurers challenge Innocence Mk XI at rock, paper, scissors at once, the majority will decide the victory/loss.

The goal is to defeat 6 out of 8 Innocence Mk XI robots!
Defeat 6 or more Innocence Mk XI and the attack is successful! Innocence Mk XII will lose power and collapse.
Fail to defeat 6 or more Innocence Mk XI, then the attack has failed! Innocence Mk XII will then unleash a devastating large-scale attack.

Isabella, furious that Marni is stealing the show for Halloween, will appear in the vicinity of Costa Farm.
She will bring monsters to fight alongside her so Adventurers should come prepared. If you’ve defeated Isabella, don’t let your guard down because the battle isn’t over yet!

Don’t relax since it’s not over yet! While she gathers her power, Isabella will call on Pumpkin Ghosts and Hexe Marie to try and take down Adventurers.
Hexe Marie and the Pumpkin Ghosts will protect Isabella by engaging with Adventurers, giving her time to recover her strength.
Defeating Isabella in this last phase, will dispel the magic that was holding the Pumpkin Ghosts and Hexe Marie, letting them fade back into the ether.


Subtópico: Dark Rifts
Conteúdo do Subtópico:


Once your character reaches Lv. 56, several dark rifts will open throughout Black Desert’s world.Defeat the bosses that appear from them to obtain rare items such as the Box of the Dead, Remnants of the Rift, and PEN (V) Boss Gear quest chain materials. Note that the Dark Rift feature is individual to each Adventurer, and thus you have to defeat these bosses alone. You cannot team up with other Adventurers to face them, as the bosses won’t appear to them.

Additionally, you can also access the Dark Rift window via the main menu (hotkey: Esc).

You can learn the following information by clicking on the Dark Rift icon at the bottom right section of your screen.
The Box of the Dead level is decided according to this level. ④ This is the reward that can be obtained after defeating the boss. However, Remnants of the Rift can be obtained according to a set probability.


◈ Difficulty Level and Characteristics

Although there are differences depending on the type of boss that appears, and the difficulty that changes over time as it decreases in level, overall if you have Narchillan or PEN (V) Tuvala equipment you can defeat them easily.

Additionally, keep in mind that there is no penalty for falling in battle against these bosses. If you attempt to battle them again, the boss's HP consumed in the previous battle is maintained, which will allow you to defeat it even over multiple attempts.

◈ Reopening

After defeating a boss, the dark rift that brought it will disappear, and after a variable amount of time has elapsed it will reappear.The rifts do not reappear at a set rate, but they will reopen no later than ten days after a boss has been defeated. Therefore, once a dark rift is opened, defeating the boss that emerges from it as quickly as possible means the rift will open again that much more quickly. However, if you find it difficult to defeat it, wait 24 hours for the difficulty to drop, and try again.


The main reward that can be obtained in Dark Rift encounters is the Box of the Dead, from which you can obtain items such as Cron Stones or an accessory up to DUO (II), according to a set probability. Dark Spirit's Greed and Memory Fragments can be commonly obtained as well.Some of the bosses that appear from the rifts will drop PEN (V) Boss Gear quest chain materials such as Concentrated Boss Crystals and Boss’ Latent Auras.

The Box of the Dead comes in four varieties.

Types of

Box of the Desperate Dead
The lowest level of Box of the Dead │ Can be obtained from some bosses of Normal difficulty.   - It includes a blue-grade accessory that is relatively cheap. - May include Cron Stones or an accessory up to DUO (II) according to a set probability.

Subtópico: Villas
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
The villas scattered all around Valencia are owned by wealthy NPCs.Adventurers can buy a 7-day invitation to access them with 10 million silver (villa shop) or a Gold Bar 100G (exchange option, seen in the picture below).

In the various villas you’ll be able to access daily quests, purchase potions and other items, and make repairs. This means that on your travels in the desert kingdom you won’t need to go to far away towns to do any of these thanks to the villas.

The most important function of a villa is that you can buy buffs that are useful for your adventures. There are many buffs to choose from, and they can for example increase the earned Combat EXP or Life EXP, your character’s resistance or attack, and more.



To get a villa invitation, you’ll have to either pay using a gold bar or purchase the invitation from the local villa keeper with silver.

You can exchange silver for gold bars through the same Villa Butler NPCs that offer you the buffs, but remember that you cannot access the silver that is in your town storage.Thus, you’ll need to carry the silver in your inventory for you to get gold bars at a villa.



Villas can be found surrounding the great inner desert all over Valencia and in the capital.All the villas are visible on the World Map (hotkey: M) even if you did not explore the area previously. You can either look for villas near the area where you want to defeat monsters, or get the buff you want before going there.

Please note that villa buffs cannot be stacked. If you already have the Turning Gates buff and then purchase the Skill and Experience buff, the Turning Gates buff will be removed.

◈ Villa Daily Quests
Some of the different villa managers have daily quests that can be completed in the vicinity.You’ll receive 1G gold bars as a reward. This can be helpful if you forgot to take silver with you and want to purchase a villa buff.

​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
Remember to search for each villa’s manager in case you require a few gold bars to purchase the local villa buff.

Subtópico: Marni’s Stone
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
These stones are one of many creations the strange and mysterious mad scientist Marni has left behind.

The stones can collect samples from monsters if you carry them during your time battling them.You will get a sample from each monster you defeat.

Take the filled stones to the NPC Wacky Toshi and he will give you a set amount of Combat EXP according to your character level.



Wacky Toshi sells you empty Marni’s Stones and will gladly take them back once they’ve been filled with monster samples.

​​​​​​​
Some of the many locations one can find Wacky Toshi. Chances are, if you wander around the entrance of a monster zone, you might find them there, waiting for Adventurers to approach them.

Your character must be Lv. 56 or higher to use Marni’s Stones. Characters under Lv. 56 cannot buy these stones, and won’t be able to collect samples even if they have them in their inventory.

Marni’s Stones have the name of the monster you need to collect samples from.For example, the item Marni’s Stone (Bashim) requires you to defeat monsters at Bashim Base, in Valencia.

You can buy multiple stones at once. The samples will be collected in the first stone you bought. Once it’s full, the next stone will start to fill.You must get the last hit on the monster to collect its sample. This means that being in a party or in a situation where another Adventurer can take the last hit may slow you down.

A Marni’s Stone must be in the inventory of the character defeating monsters to fill it with samples. It won’t get filled if they are in another character’s inventory, storage, or your mount’s inventory.

For a better experience, you can right-click the Marni’s Stone in your inventory and select Item Count to be able to more easily keep track of the monsters you need to defeat.

Return to Wacky Toshi to exchange the stones once they are full. You’ll see the exchange button if the full stones are in your inventory.As mentioned previously, you will be able to exchange them for a fixed amount of Combat EXP.In certain cases, Wacky Toshi will exchange them for items instead of Combat EXP, as is the case for the stones with samples from monsters affected by the Elvia Realm in Serendia.
As you journey throughout the world, you may find yourself in possession of Great Marni’s Stones.These once lost experimental stones can be filled with a lot more samples compared to the other stones.

The process is the same. Fill a Great Marni’s Stone, and once full, bring it to Wacky Toshi. However, you will see you’re not given Combat EXP as a reward. For your assistance, they will reward you with a Great Marni’s Supply Box, which contains one out of several possible yellow grade accessories, PRI (I) to DUO (II).

You can only accept these quests if the Combat quest filter is toggled on in the Quest window (hotkey: O).

After acquiring all the titles from the 19 available Great Marni’s Stones, you can obtain the "Great Marni's Assistant" title via Wacky Toshi.

Furthermore, you can also access it from the option in the main menu, in the same Adventure tab where the Marni’s Realm is located.
◈ Desert Regions & Pila Ku Jail
As navigation for several of the monster zones in Valencia is not available, we will show you the designated area where you can enter their Marni’s Realm area.

As for Pila Ku Jail, you can enter Marni’s Realm from the plaza entrance near NPC Botadin.




There is a 5 min. cooldown before being allowed back into Marni’s Realm after leaving it.

Subtópico: Altar of Training
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
The Altar of Training is where the descendants of Sylvia go to undertake training and face trials to prove their strength and be recognized as saints.

Adventurers can create a party to face the five trials and their final bosses to get valuable rewards.

◈ How to Participate
There are currently 3 ways to participate in the Altar of Training.

The first is through the main questline of Kamasylvia. Once you reach Lv. 58 or higher, you can proceed with the main questline. As soon as you’ve completed the quest [Kamasylvia] The Heart of Kamasylve the Black Spirit will offer you the quest Light to Valtarra, leading you to the area. Once there, you can accept the quest [Co-op] Proof of Courage from NPC Milford.

Milford will give you the item Valtarra: Introductory Training Manual to start the altar training.

The main questline can only be completed once per character, and thus this method cannot be repeated often.

The second is by completing the repeatable quest [Training Quest] Valtarra - Ruins Sacrament.

Once your character is Lv. 58 or higher and has completed the last quest [Kamasylvia] The Healing Light in the main questline for Kamasylvia, you can accept this quest from Milford every 3 days.You’ll need to spend 100 energy after accepting the quest by talking to Milford. He will give you the Valtarra: Training Manual item necessary to start the altar training session.

The last method is by completing the weekly quest [Training Quest] Valtarra - To a Higher Place (1/W).You can accept this quest if you have completed the previously mentioned [Training Quest] Valtarra - Ruins Sacrament at least once and your character is Lv. 58 or higher.You’ll receive the item Valtarra: Advanced Training Manual necessary to start the advanced altar training session by completing the quest.

The location of the altar can be seen by right-clicking on the training manual you get from the quests mentioned above.

Right-click on the item at the Altar of Training to begin the training session.You must be in a party that has at least 2 members to use the training manual.
The battle encounter begins a few moments after you use the training manual item.

Your goal is to protect the sacrament that appears in the middle from the monsters that try to destroy it.When the sacrament is destroyed, it means you’ve failed the training session.If you want to try again, talk to Milford and spend energy to get another training manual.

However, keep in mind that the advanced training manual can only be used once per week. It can only be obtained by completing the weekly repeatable quest. This means that, if you fail the advanced training session, you will have to wait a week before challenging it again.
As seen above, if you fail, you must start again from the beginning.

The Altar of Training has 5 levels that continue non-stop, one after another.Once you defeat the initial swarm of monsters, you’ll see a message that announces the start of Training II and a marker at the top of the hill.The marker indicates where the sacrament will be summoned, and soon after monsters will appear to destroy it.

However, Training II starting does not mean that Training I ended. If you leave the Training I area without defeating all the monsters, then the remaining monsters from Training I will destroy the sacrament.

Alternatively, If you take too long defeating the monsters from Training I, then the monsters from Training II will destroy the next sacrament.As such, it’s important to be able to complete Training I in time for you to get to Training II.

Party members are required to have a certain amount of AP or more. The more members you have, the easier it will be to complete the training.

The first level is called Forest’s Pact. Monsters like treants, mirumok ancient weapons, and other monsters that look like trees come in swarms. The boss Dim Tree Spirit will come out last to attack the challenging Adventurers.

The second level is called Flying Maverick. Monsters like gargoyles, harpies, and other winged monsters will attack from the sky. The boss King Griffon will top it off at the end.

The third training is called Earth’s Trial. Monsters like golems will appear, and the boss is Moghulis.

You must finish Training III to complete the Introductory Altar of Training. However, you must finish all 4~5 levels to complete both the normal Altar of Training and the advanced one.

The fourth level is called Verge of Death. Skeletons and cultists will appear in this round. Hexe Marie comes out as the boss to defeat.

The last level is called Guardians of the Ruins. Ancient weapons from Hystria, Aakman, and Hasrah that appear in ancient ruins will be the final trial to face. The Ancient Puturum is the last boss that emerges in the grand finale.

Get your EXP and other rewards from Milford once you’ve successfully defended your sacrement for all 5 levels.
The Altar of Training is much harder than regular combat and many of the available boss summon scrolls. This is especially true if you’re challenging the advanced training session.

The rewards for completing the Introductory Altar of Training are:Combat and Contribution EXP, Black Stones (Weapon) x5, and Black Stones (Armor) x5.

The rewards for the Altar of Training that’s available every 3 days are:Combat EXP and the Valtarra Training Reward Bundle. You can get Black Stone (Weapon), Black Stone (Armor), Hunter’s Seal, and Forest Fury from the bundle.

The Advanced Altar of Training that’s available once a week does not have quest rewards. Instead, you can loot the bosses that you defeat and collect special seals from them. These seals can then be combined to create tokens. You can right-click each of the tokens to get quests. These quests are then completed by talking to Milford. Finally, you’ll receive a matching bundle for completing them.

The bundles contain Valtarra's Scattered Aura. There’s also a chance to get a Courser Awakening Material Box.If you’ve collected x20 Valtarra's Scattered Aura, exchange them for a Valtarra Eclipsed Belt through Milford.

You can also get the Valtarra Eclipsed Belt from the bundles as well.

To keep Kzarka bound, Hadum has raised the Barrier of Infestation, which allows only one Adventurer to enter the fight to free Kzarka. Thus, one has to muster up the courage to face Kzarka alone.

Having gone berserk to fight off Hadum's encroachment, Kzarka now displays an incredibly powerful and frightening arsenal of attacks, but this comes at the cost of its health pool.
You can enter the Barrier of Infestation content after completing the questline that starts with [Elvia] Obsidian Ashes in the Suggested tab of the Quest window (hotkey: O), and then accepting the quest [Elvia] Dreary Moonlight from the Black Spirit.

You must be Lv. 61 or higher to proceed with the quest [Elvia] Obsidian Ashes.You can only accept the quest [Elvia] Dreary Moonlight while inside the Elvia Realm.

Subtópico: Abyss One: The Magnus
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
You'll be able to choose one piece of boss defense gear enhanced to the maximum enhancement level of PEN (V) (once per Family).
This is identical to the guaranteed PEN (V) boss gear you can obtain through the questline with Jetina, and thus it cannot be registered on the Central Market.

For the helmet and armor pieces, if you enhance them past Caphras Lv. 10, you'll be able to craft them into one of the Slumbering Origin Armor pieces (Fallen God's Armor or Labreska's Helmet, respectively), which can then be registered on the Central Market.

You can utilize the Magnus, which stretches out all over the world of Black Desert, to travel between major cities.
However, if your locations for entering and leaving the Magnus differ, a certain amount of Silver is consumed depending on the distance.
- e.g. 1) Bartali Farm in Balenos → Serendia Eastern Border: 1 million Silver
- e.g. 2) Grána Dirt Farm in Kamasylvia → Fohalam Farm in Valencia: 14.8 million Silver

Subtópico: Black Shrine (Boss Blitz)
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
You have 5 weekly attempts per family to defeat bosses of the Black Shrine. If you successfully defeat the bosses at each difficulty, it will be deducted from your total count. (Resets at Midnight on Sunday)If a boss at a certain difficulty is successfully defeated, the number of attempts will not be deducted even if you challenge them again with the same character, at the same difficulty.Note that the number of attempts will not be deducted if you are defeated or forfeit.

If all five weekly attempts have been used, you can continue to challenge the levels you've successfully cleared, and your highest record will be reflected in your Boss Blitz ranking.Please note that these conditions apply only to the same character who has successfully defeated a boss. If you proceed to defeat the bosses with a different character, it will be deducted from your total number of weekly attempts.
The Black Shrine offers 10 levels of difficulty, called calamities. From Calamity 1 to Calamity 10.The higher the boss’ difficulty, the more diverse its attack patterns are, and the greater the potential for better loot and rewards.

Boss battles are recorded based on the level of difficulty, and by class.When a Black Shrine boss is first defeated on each difficulty level, and by each class, the name of the Adventurer (that first defeated the boss at each difficulty level) is announced throughout the world of Black Desert.Calamity 1 to 5 bosses are open to all classes.Calamity 6 to 10 bosses will only unlock if an Adventurer successfully defeats the boss of the previous level. This is applied for each class separately.
◈ What Are Light Orbs? Boss Blitz Guidelines
These are points that can be obtained while completing the main questline for LoML and are closely related to the attributes of each boss.

Before delving into light orbs, it is necessary to understand how stats are applied in the Black Shrine boss encounters.

• The bosses of the Black Shrine receive/deal damage based on a ratio of 90% aura attribute and 10% character attack/defense power.• Only 10% of the skill add-on effects and buff effects related to the character’s AP/DP are applied.• Only critical hits from attribute attacks are displayed during the boss blitz. (Critical hits based on the character’s existing stats are applied, but are not displayed.)• The critical hit rate for attribute attacks is applied at 50% during the boss blitz.• All debuff resistance is applied at 20% during the boss blitz. (Resistances that have been increased due to a character’s existing stats are not applied.)

Therefore, it is extremely important to obtain and utilize the orbs acquired during the main questline to increase aura stats for a confident victory!

Adventurers can check the sun/moon/earth attribute weaknesses of each boss and invest in the auras/attributes that the boss they wish to take down is weak to.
Sun Orb, Moon Orb, Earth OrbInvesting these orbs allows one to gain additional stats against bosses with weaknesses to sun, moon, and earth elements. You can obtain some by proceeding with the main quests.
Light OrbAllows one to invest in the aura of their choice among sun, moon, and earth. It also allows one to gain additional EXP upon investing orbs in auras the boss has a weakness to. You can obtain some by proceeding with the main quests.

Investing a light orb increases attack power (AP) by 50 and defense power (DP) by 100 for that attribute/aura each time you invest one, and it grants you 3 additional stat points.Additional stat points can be invested in attack power or defense power at the Adventurer's discretion.

The screen below is what you can see when you click '② Manage Aura' in the image shown earlier above. In the UI, you can see the number of light orbs you have and their investment status.
After you successfully defeat bosses in the Black Shrine, on Sunday at 00:00 (server time), you will receive rewards based on your kill record and ranking.

Acquired rewards can be claimed from the Black Shrine menu.

Subtópico: Dehkia’s Lantern
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
Dehkia’s Lantern is an artifact discovered in the ancient stronghold, Atoraxxion, by Lafi Bedmountain of the Secret Guards. He named it Dehkia’s Lantern, speculating it was an enhancement device for ancient weapons created by Atoraxxion’s founder, Dehkia, in preparation for the black spirits’ invasion. However, further investigation has revealed this may not have been the case.

Upon using this artifact in certain monster zones, all nearby affected monsters will awaken into a state of chaos, increasing their strength and making them repeatedly reappear after defeating them, with no waiting time.

Note that awakened monsters will disappear once the durability of Dehkia’s Lantern is spent.


Dehkia’s Light is obtained by heating (hotkey: L) certain PRI to TRI enhancement level yellow-grade accessories together with magical lightstone crystals.

Depending on the enhancement level of the accessory and what type of accessory it is, you will obtain a different amount of Dehkia’s Light.

Subtópico: Calpheon Leveling
Conteúdo do Subtópico:


You should get ready to go to southwestern Calpheon once you get to Lv. 47~48. It might be overwhelming for a beginner since the area is so big, but since the main questline will send you here and several monster zones have distinct features, we recommend you take a look around.

You can overall look around the monster zones in whatever order you want. You will see your character grows as you visit the places that suit your level. However, we recommend you to visit North Kaia Mountain, the restricted territory of the Abandoned Monastery, and Star’s End at a later time, when you’ve grown much more powerful, since the monsters in those areas will be beyond your ability to defeat right now.

3. Strategies
1) Precautions
Most monsters will attack from a distance, but it’s not a big problem since they are gathered together. If your stats are low, it might be difficult to fight the ogres. Their every attack is strong, and they use skill debuff skills, so it would be difficult to fight them if you just reached Lv. 50. However, if you succeed, you might get an Ogre Ring at a low chance.

2) Key Locations and Route
Mansha goblins are widely spread, so finish one area first and then move to another.




4. Major Item Drops
• Ogre Ring• Treant Spirit’s Echo Ring• Goblin Chief Summon Scroll• Black Stone (Armor & Weapon)• Soiled Ogre Ring• Ancient Spirit Dust• Ancient Relic Crystal Shard
5. User Density
The ‘Ogre Ring’ that the ogres drop is one of the best accessories in the entire game, so even high-level Adventurers visit the area from time to time. There are enough ogres for the area to not get too crowded, and they are not interested in the Mansha goblins, so you can hunt them at ease. If you are a brave Adventurer, you should challenge yourself and hunt down the ogres sometime.

2) Key Locations and RouteIf your level is in the early 50s, you shouldn’t have much to worry about. But as mentioned earlier, the Witch Chapel’s node where the green orc skeletons appear is a popular place, so you might not be alone.

1) PrecautionsMutant tree spirits are capable of using both melee and ranged skills. These tree spirits let you know when they’re going for a melee attack by the way they move, so you might have time to dodge their attacks. However, you need to attack the monsters from behind, since they bombard you with continued attacks along with debuff skills.Even if you get them from behind, they also carry out 360º attacks, so you need to know how to avoid them or defend yourself. Use food or elixirs along with high-level equipment in order to be more efficient, just like when you’re fighting against the Wilderness Golem in Mediah.

2) Key Locations and RouteThe monsters are spread widely, so try to remember where they appear.

It’s not an easy type of monster to defeat, so beginner Adventurers do not tend to visit the area. The combat EXP is rarely worth it, but it’s quite popular since a dark rift boss, such as the Dim Tree Spirit, can appear here.

Very few Adventurers are able to subjugate the monsters here, so brace yourself.



◈ Vessel of Inquisition
The vessels of inquisition have been discovered in parts of Star's End where Adventurers rarely set foot. The rotting stench of the Blackstar from the vessels of inquisition envelopes all of Star's End, making Kzarka's apostles covet the energy contained within and grow stronger.



Strike a vessel of inquisition to call forth Kzarka's apostles, who will charge at the vessel in waves.The apostles will attack the vessel of inquisition to obtain the energy spilling out from the fragment of the Blackstar. They will disperse once the vessel of inquisition is destroyed. In this sense, the vessels of inquisition work similarly to the traitor’s graveyard of Hexe Sanctuary, explained above.

Please note that the apostles coveting the power within the vessel are stronger than previously described Star's End monsters.The vessel of inquisition will shatter if too many apostles coveting its power gather and attack it.



The Abandoned Monastery in southwestern Calpheon has been known as a repenting ground for Elionian priests. There are occasional reports about missing Adventurers around this place, but for some reason, the Kalis hasn't sent any investigators.

Calpheon Shadow Knights in the Abandoned Monastery have become stronger due to Kzarka's blessing. In response, the inner areas of the cave complex beneath the monastery have been deemed restricted territory.

1) Basic Information• Mostly Lv. 65~66 monsters (human-type)• Melee: Calpheon Shadow Knight, Calpheon Elite Shadow Knight, Calpheon Elite Shadow Priestess, Calpheon Shadow Guard• Ranged: Calpheon Shadow Wizard 2) FeaturesThe monsters here have been blessed by the Lord of Corruption himself, granting them strength beyond imagination. As such, the restricted territory is a party zone, allowing groups of 2 Adventurers to loot together.

As you defeat the Shadow Knights in here, dawn’s grudges will accumulate. Once five dawn’s grudges have accumulated in the area, a server-wide message will warn of the appearance of the Specter of Belmorn.

The Specter of Belmorn is a boss-type enemy with choreographed attacks. Defeating it gives the item Dawn’s Resentment, which can be put together with others to craft the yellow grade accessory Dawn Earring.

Both Dawn’s Resentment and Dawn Earring also have a low chance to be dropped by this monster zone’s enemies.

The well in the Abandoned Monastery is connected to the dungeon below, and within it, you’ll need to find the passageway into the restricted territory. You can also find several other entrances to the cave complex, including one directly to the restricted territory, in the mountains to the east, from Treant Forest.

There are several ways to be introduced to the surroundings of the Mountain of Eternal Winter. You may be led there from having finished Atoraxxion: Sycrakea, Drieghan’s main questline, or having started a new character there. Regardless of how you arrived, you’ll be presented with a main questline where you’ll follow the son of the Khan of the Abets in search of his father and brother, find yourself collaborating with an unlikely figure from past adventures, discover what occurred in this territory in the distant past, and figure out who is behind the recent chaos that has befallen the Mountain of Eternal Winter and its inhabitants.

Most of the monster zones in this territory focus on facing off against unending waves of monsters, with Jade Starlight Forest offering a nice counterpart with fewer but stronger enemies.In these areas, you will obtain the Flame of Frost, a crafting material for the much sought-after Labreska’s Helmet, but beware of the sporadic snowstorms that batter the territory during your time here, as some say in their center one can find the Dreadwinter Guardian, Erebjork.

1) Basic Information• Mostly Lv. 61-66 monsters• Melee: Panvalla, Breukia, Winter Root Treant• Melee/Ranged: Winter Nest Treant• Ranged: Titika, Komau• Others: Takium 2) FeaturesYou can find winter trees spread all over the Mountain of Eternal Winter region. Usually, they'll be emitting a beautiful blue light, but those tainted with dark energies become dreadwinter tree fossils that influence the winter spirits nearby. Defeat the tainted spirits so that their souls may return to and cleanse the winter trees.

You can choose the difficulty when interacting with a dreadwinter tree fossil, and use 100 energy to start the encounter. Once it has begun, waves of frenzied winter spirits will appear around the tainted winter tree. They need to be dealt with quickly, as otherwise, the presence of too many of them will end the encounter.

You will notice that from time to time Takium appears. These monsters will not attack you. They’re attracted to the dreadwinter tree, and upon contact with it will explode. This can help you clear away the area of monsters, but know that the monsters defeated by a Takium’s explosion cannot be looted.

As you deal with the waves of monsters, increasingly powerful varieties of some of them will appear, ending with a violent, gigantic version of Breukia as a kind of final boss.Upon defeating this Breukia you have a better chance of being rewarded with good items.

Do not let the Komau on their own for too long, as they will grow in size and fill the entire area with an area-of-effect attack that will force you to back away and go after them.

2) Key Locations and RouteThere are no routes or key locations in this monster zone, as all dreadwinter tree fossils are in static locations throughout the territory.

1) Basic Information• Mostly Lv. 66 monsters• Melee: Erekhantus 2) FeaturesYou can enter Erethea's Limbo via the door that leads to the Haven of Slumbering Origin located deep within the Mountain of Eternal Winter.To begin Erethea's Limbo, you require a Forgotten Witch's Token, an item scattered throughout the region that can be obtained from the other monster zones described above.

Within Erethea's Limbo, "Erekhantus," beings imbued with mighty power by Erethea, will appear.Only those who overcome the trials of the maze-like chambers will be able to enter the Golden Chamber.

Erethea’s Trial
The trial at Erethea's Limbo will end 60 minutes after it begins.When you enter Erethea's Limbo with the Forgotten Witch's Token in your possession, interact with Erethea’s Slate and symbols will appear on four gems. The goal of Erethea's Limbo is to find all the chambers with the relevant symbols engraved on them and to overcome the trial in each.

Interacting with the door in each chamber will take you to another chamber with a different symbol. Note that all the doors at the starting point are activated already, but the doors of other chambers will open when you overcome the trial of that room.

The trial will begin once you enter another chamber. The trial can take several forms: defeating the souls of origin to weaken the Erekhantus and fill the limbo spires with their grudges, defending the spires from the souls of origin in pain, or for example, gathering the souls of origin to to imbue the spires with their power.Depending on how well you've accomplished the requirement for each trial, one to three doors will open. Due to this, a door you are attempting to open to complete your four given symbols may not open.The color of the symbol will be displayed on the opened doors, and doors that remain closed will be veiled in dark energy.



If you move to a chamber that is not linked to the chamber with the symbol you aimed for, or if the doors with the symbols you aimed for do not open due to failing the trial, you can return to the starting point through the doors located north of each chamber.

Due to the nature of Erethea’s Limbo, accessed only if you have obtained a specific item in the other monster zones of Mountain of Eternal Winter, and the way it works, more like a series of puzzles than a traditional monster zone, you won’t be disturbed by other Adventurers here.As the Forgotten Witch’s Token is a rare item to come by, do Erethea’s Limbo whenever you obtain one, and take it as more of an extra reward for the time you’ve spent in the surroundings of the former Golden Mountain.

After finishing the main questline of Kamasylvia you will have access to the main questline of O’dyllita to its east. Divided into two halves, the quests will take you throughout the territory where you’ll get to know the different factions living there and the ancient history of this land permeated in darkness. Do not worry if the monster zones you visit during the quests are too hard for you, as the quests won’t ask you to defeat these powerful monsters most of the time.

Tunkuta, home of the Turos, and Olun’s Valley, where strange golems lie dormant, are recommended for groups of two and three Adventurers, respectively. In contrast, Thornwood Forest and the Crypt of Resting Thoughts are designed for solo activity. However, while the monsters you find down in the crypt’s prison look the same as those you’ll encounter throughout the outside forest, do not make the error of thinking you’ll be able to defeat them as easily. Their difference in power, attributed to the degree of corruption they’ve succumbed to, puts them worlds apart in difficulty.

The Tungrad Ruins, where the Tungrad School once researched the Black Spirit’s rage, are buried here.

When the Three Days of Darkness, which originated in Mediah, reached Ulukita, the native Uluan people reached out to the sealed Tungrad School as a last resort to protect their land. The power of the Black Spirit, buried within the Tungrad School, was thought to be the only way to overcome the Three Days of Darkness. They had spent a long time with the Tungrad priests in ancient times, so they thought they could handle the Black Spirit. However, contrary to their hopes, the Black Spirit released from the school mixed with the Three Days of Darkness, and turned them into monsters of rage.

Skill is the most important factor in combat.In Black Desert, the more you level up the more skills you can learn. Through defeating monsters and completing quests you’ll get enough skill experience to obtain all the skill points you require to learn all available skills.However, keep in mind that when you’ve acquired a certain amount of skill points, it’ll become more difficult to earn additional points. The maximum number of skill points obtainable from defeating monsters and training at a dummy is 3,000 points. That said, one may exceed this number with the skill points acquired from quests and adventure journals.



Skill points needed for obtaining skills can be basically earned through battle.You can also earn a small amount of skill experience through life skills, and some quests will reward you with skill experience, or directly with skill points.

There are several ways to learn skill points.


Note that, if you are able to learn skills, the crossed knife and shield icon will appear.The number of skills that you can learn will be displayed.



Remember that all the locations of the skill instructors you’ve met will be displayed on the World Map screen (hotkey: M) with the same icon as the new skill available icon in the bottom part of the UI (below).


After level 56, when you complete the Awakening, Ascension (Archer), or Talent (Shai) quests through the Black Spirit, you will be able to learn skills that allow you to use a different weapon for stronger attacks.

If you want to continue with the same combat style you’ve been using up to Lv. 56, you can empower your previously existing skills after completing the Succession quests.

Awakening skills can only be acquired by completing the Awakening quests, and Succession skills can only be acquired by completing the Succession quests. Please note that, depending on the class, the order in which you complete these quests might be different.


Skills are divided into two types: Active and Passive.

Active skills can be used via hotkeys or by inserting precise commands, while passive skills are those where the effects are applied just by learning the skill.

Keep in mind that some skills cannot be placed in a quick slot, so it is important to familiarize yourself with the commands to activate those skills.




If the phrase 'Can be added to a Quick Slot' isn’t there, it means the skill can be only used through command. In the example above, by pressing the walk backwards key (S) and the right mouse button (RMB) at the same time.

You can also use most of the skills on horseback.In order to enable horseback combat, you must equip your horse with stirrups.The commands for skills on horseback might be a little bit different from those on the ground, so it is useful to read the skill description.


The higher the skill level, the higher the required amount of skill points to learn it.If you learn all possible skills as soon as you’re able, recklessly, you might not have enough skill points to learn the ones you desire.

Therefore, you need to check what kind of skills your character has and learn them more effectively. Through skill descriptions and videos you can learn which skill you need to focus on and finish your own skill tree.


Press K on your keyboard to view the Skill window.



In this window, you can view skill demos on the left, and the skills themselves on the right. Succession, Awakening, Talent, or Ascension skills can be accessed from the top-right of the screen once you’ve completed the respective classes’ corresponding quests. However, you can still view the main, awakening, and skill enhancement categories through ② regardless of whether or not you completed the quests.



On the skill demo screen, you can select the skill icon or press the playback button at the bottom of the skill demo screen to view a video demonstration of the skill.You can also read the detailed skill description of the skill of your choice through the skill demo screen. Of course, you can also hover over the skill icon with your cursor to see the skill description.

If you don’t want to see the skill demo screen, you can toggle it on/off with the “Toggle Skill Demo Screen” button.



You can also playback the skill demos or reset the camera viewpoint with the “Play Skill Demo” and “Reset Camera” button at the bottom of the skill demo screen.



The skill window’s main weapon skills are divided into main, secondary, and passive skills. You can press each categories’ title bar to view or hide the skills in them.



Left-click a skill icon to learn the skill, and press Shift + Left-click on a skill icon to continuously learn up to the skill’s max level available.Characters under lv. 56 can freely reset all learned skills, and you can reset an individual skill by right-clicking the skill icon or Shift + Right click it to reset the skill to level 1.



The “Black Spirit’s Rage” and “Skill Cooldown Slot” buttons on the lower-right part of the Skill window allow you to disable the application of black spirit’s rage for individual skills and set a skill to appear in the cooldown slots on your combat UI.

➤ Please check the [Black Spirit’s Rage] page for more information about this feature.



The skill preset is a feature that allows you to save your currently learned skills and skill add-ons. You can get more skill preset slots by using the Skill Preset Coupon. Two Skill Preset Coupons can also be obtained as rewards for completing each character’s Awakening and Succession quest (Talent/Ascension for Shai/Archer).

If you’ve already completed the Awakening/Succession/Talent/Ascension quests, you can accept the [Skill Preset Coupon] Using a Variety of Skills quest from the Black Spirit to get a Skill Preset Coupon.

The Skill Preset save feature can be used wherever, whenever, but you’ll need the Secret Book of Old Moon or a Skill Instructor NPC to load a saved skill preset.




There’s a 10 minute cooldown time if you load a skill preset with a skill instructor, and a 1 hour cooldown time if you use a Secret Book of Old Moon. In addition, you can only load a skill preset at a safe zone when using a Secret Book of Old Moon.

Lastly, your character will perform an animation when loading a saved skill preset.



If you read the skill description, you can see that many skills have notations of additional effects. These effects enable you to continue the combat in a more convenient and stable manner.For example, a skill with a 'Down Attack' can cause additional damage if you use it after knocking down the enemy. This is the same theory with damage increasing when you make a 'Back Attack' at the back of the enemy. So if you know what skill has which effect, you can cause even more damage using it in the best moment.

In addition to the effects increasing damage in certain situations, there is also a way to neutralize the enemy in various forms. You can stun your enemy so that it can’t do anything for a short period of time, or you can knock them down with the objective to apply a down attack on them. By combining these effects, you can defeat your enemies more efficiently.

The following indicates the skill effects available in Black Desert.


Note that, in the case of certain enemies, their basic state is being in the air or on the ground.If you are aware of the nature of the enemy, you can be more effective when battling them.

Next is a list of the defensive effects skills can apply.


Finally, certain skills may also possess a damage increase modifier in the right situations. These are called special damage types.



Skill add-ons refer to the additional effects you can “add-on” to certain skills to aid you greatly in combat. They can be easily applied to your skills if you meet the necessary requirements, and the effects are a must-have for Adventurers seeking to improve themselves.

Skill add-ons require you to be Lv. 50 or higher.

➤ Please check the [Skill Add-ons] page for more information about this feature.


You can use most of the active skills with commands, enabling greatly dynamic battles.If you want to truly experience the dynamic and active controls of the game, use commands instead of using skills put in quick slots. If you want to play the game more comfortably, you can drag the skills into a quick slot and enjoy the game at your own pace.As for some skills, using hotkeys and commands might have slightly different effects. For example, when using a command, some skills have a faster activation speed.If you use commands instead of using quick slots, there is also a slight reduction in the consumption of skill resources (WP, MP, SP).The use of commands also allows you to smoothly link skills together, creating skill combos.Skills which can be used in skill combos will be displayed on the 'Action Combo Guide' on the right side of your character.Lastly, when using a gamepad, you can set your preferred shortcut keys to better enjoy the experience.


Through the main menu (hotkey: Esc), when you go into Edit UI, you can turn on and off the action combo guide.



When you turn on the action combo guide, you can see the commands of the skills currently available in real time.

Skill add-ons refer to the additional effects you can “add-on” to certain skills to aid you greatly in combat.

Skill add-ons can be easily applied to your skills if you meet the necessary requirements, and the effects are a must-have for Adventurers seeking to improve themselves.

Skill add-ons require you to be Lv. 50 or higher.You can apply up to 6 skill add-ons, with each one unlocked at levels 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, and 60.

➤ For the basics regarding skills in Black Desert, please check the [Skills] page.


◈ How to Apply Skill Add-ons
① Once you’ve reached Lv. 50, head to the nearest Skill Instructor NPC in any major city.



Regardless of their location, these NPCs all offer the same functions. Find one in a major city near you to use the Skill Add-ons function.

② Interact with the NPC, then select “Skill Add-ons" to proceed to the screen displayed below:



③ First, select the skill you wish to “add-on” an effect to.



It’s most efficient to choose a skill you use regularly in battle, and one that has a short cooldown.

④ Lastly, select the effect from the list that you wish to “add-on” to the selected skill.



You can select up to two different effects, which will activate when the selected skill hits a target.


◈ How to Efficiently Use Skill Add-ons

1. First Method
You cannot stack the same "add-on" effect multiple times on one skill. However, you can choose to have the same effect for other skills.

For example, you can’t “add-on” the “Extra Damage to Monsters +20 for 7 sec“ effect to skill (A) twice, but you can add that same effect to both skills (A) and (B).

That said, do note that applying the same effect to skills (A) and (B) will not result in an extension of the effect’s duration (i.e., “Extra Damage to Monsters +20 for 14 sec) but will rather re-apply the original effect each time skills (A) and (B) hit a target.

Therefore, you must consider the skills you combo with during battles, which skill add-on effects will be most important to maintain active during combat, that you aren’t over-investing wholly in just one single effect, and that you’re activating multiple skill add-on effects in order to utilize them efficiently.


2. Second MethodThe types of skill add-on effects you can apply to skills are the same, but there are discrepancies in the numerical values applied to certain skills.Please refer to the examples below:





Example 1) Berserker > Skill Add-on effects for "Fearsome Tyrant”Example 2) Berserker > Skill Add-on effects for "Rock Smash”

As observed above, the numerical values of skill add-on effects differ per skill.Therefore, it is important to calculate the actual values of the effects applied to the skills used in your combos to make the most efficient use of skill add-ons.


– Playable CharacterAll playable characters in Black Desert. Regardless of their appearance, they are considered to be human.The same goes for characters like the cute little Shai and the pointed-eared Dark Knight.

– MonsterIn the case of monsters, the types of monsters that can be encountered in the different monster zones are divided into four categories: Humans, Demihuman, Kamasylvian, and Neutral.


If you remember the icon for each type, you can quickly identify a monster’s type by checking the icon next to their health bar.


In short, if you apply an effect to do extra damage against humans through a skill add-on, it will be effective against both monsters that are considered human, and all PvP targets (other Adventurers).

* For example, in the case of human monsters, both the "monster additional attack power" effect and the "human additional damage" effect are applied.


3. How to Reset Skill Add-onsYou can change either the skill with the add-ons, or just the add-on effects, by using Memory Fragment x1.However, if you have either the Cliff's Skill Add-on Guide or the Secret Book of Old Moon buff effects active, then you can make as many changes to skill add-ons as you like, without spending any memory fragments.


4. Use Skill Presets to Save Skill Add-ons




Try using the presets in the Skills window (hotkey: K).Not only does this function allow you to save the skills you’ve learned, it also saves the skill add-on effects as well!


5. Another Way to Get Skill Add-onsTry looking for an Adventurer with the title “Unrivaled” above their head and interact with them.They have a special ability that enables other Adventurers to get skill add-ons.
* The content of the game guide may differ from the actual game content, depending on the update and content changes.

Subtópico: Black Spirit’s Rage
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
You can check out the skills that can use the Black Spirit’s rage through their tooltip in the Skills window (hotkey: K), or by clicking on the rage gauge directly, which will open the Black Spirit’s Rage window.

➤ Please check the [Skills] page for the basics regarding combat skills.

Additionally, if you inflict damage with a skill that uses the Black Spirit's rage, you may cause an injury to the opponent. This will hinder the target's HP recovery.
Injury

- When damage is inflicted with a Black Spirit's rage skill, the target is injured by a certain percentage of the damage.- If you are injured, the max HP you can recover is reduced.- All characters are equally applied with 10 injury healing per tick (5 seconds).- Continuous damage, additional % damage on HP/MP won't be applied on injury.- The degree of injury is reset when the character dies.- The level of injury does not recover when the character is not logged in. It gradually recovers from the moment you load into the game world with the character.- When using a skill using the Black Spirit's rage, the following injuries are applied.


- For example, when a Warrior attacks a Berserker with 5,000 HP using 100% of the Black Spirit's rage, and the Berserker takes 2,000 damage, the injury rate is 50% of the damage, or 1,000.- You can recover up to 4,000 from the remaining 3,000 HP through the different recovery methods. For the remaining 1,000 HP, it naturally recovers by 10 every 5 seconds until all injuries are recovered.



You can check the tooltip of the different skills that can use Black Spirit’s rage for the injury percentage.
To choose whether you want to use Rage Absorption (Common) or Rage Absorption (Innate), you can lock the skill you don’t want to use in the Skills window.

This function is very useful in combat, so you should use it at the right time. Note that you can also use up to 200% of Black Spirit’s rage with Rage Absorption.
Rage Transfer is a skill that transfers your character’s Black Spirit’s rage gauge to an ally.

You can use up all the rage gauge that you have at the moment by targeting an ally and pressing the X key. By doing this, you consume all of your character’s rage gauge and fill your ally’s by half of the consumed value. For example, if you transferred 100% of your Black Spirit’s rage gauge, you’ll end up at 0% and they’ll receive 50%.

The rage that can be obtained through Rage Transfer can be accumulated up to 200%. There are skills that can be used by consuming that much Black Spirit’s rage, so use this function on the best occasion.

Subtópico: PvP

Effects
Descriptions

Invincibility
The target will not receive any damage, effects, buffs, or heals from enemies and allies

Super Armor
The target receives damage, but it will not have CC applied
(However, grabs and debuffs get applied through this effect).

Forward Guard
The target blocks all damage and effects from the front.
(However, grabs get applied through this effect).
The target is still vulnerable to attacks and effects from behind.
The Forward Guard also has a Guard Gauge that can be broken.


Using these defensive effects at opportune times can block enemy attacks and create an opening for you to hit them back.

Additionally, certain classes have a Forward Guard applied when they walk backward (called an S-block).
There is also the class-specific guard skill (Default Key: Q) that sometimes has a powerful defensive effect.



◈ Resistances
You can gain resistance against enemy debuffs to increase your chance of avoiding them (starts from a 20% base).When you resist an effect, the damage of the skill is applied but the debuff is not. This can then create an opportunity for you to strike back or escape.

The maximum applicable resistance in PvP is 80%. So, even if your target has 100% resistance on their character, your attack with base Ignore Resistance will be calculated from 80%.

Still, you must keep in mind that a target hit by 2 counts or more of CC will be completely immune to CC for 5 seconds.





◈ Penalty-free PvP
If you wanted to try PvP but were afraid of possible penalties that can come from it, there are a number of modes we recommend trying. – Battle Arena and other Arenas To enter the Battle Arena, go to the main menu (hotkey: Esc) → War → Battle Arena to enter the arena at any time.Alternatively, there are arenas near Velia and other major cities where you can fight against other Adventurers without receiving any penalties for dying or killing.

➤ You can read more about them in the [Battle Arena] and [Town Arena] pages.

– DuelsYou can interact with an Adventurer and challenge them to a duel.The duel will begin immediately when the opponent accepts your duel request. You can duel Adventurers anywhere in the Black Desert world, excluding safe zones.If you die in a duel, you can resurrect on the spot without receiving any penalties. Buffs that would normally be lost on death, such as elixirs, will still be lost.

– Red Battlefield Go to the main menu (hotkey: Esc) → War → Red Battlefield to enter the Red Battlefield whenever you’d like.Here, you can duke it out with other Adventurers for 20 minutes on a battlefield of your choice.There are no penalties for dying on the Red Battlefield. You will simply get resurrected at your team’s starting point and be able to run back into the fight.

➤ You can read more about this mode in the [Red Battlefield] page.

– Node/Conquest Wars This content requires you to be in a guild to participate.In these wars your guild builds a fort or Field HQ in certain areas across the world of Black Desert to fight against other guilds that are participating in the same area. Your guild wins if it is the last guild with its fort or Field HQ.

Besides Node/Conquest Wars, there is Siege War. In Siege War, your guild can utilize siege weapons to attack enemy forts.There are no penalties applied for dying during the Node/Conquest War. You will simply get resurrected at your guild’s fort or Field HQ where you can immediately jump back into the fight.
To learn more about how Node Wars work check out our official guide video here:


– Guild Wars Your guild can declare war upon another guild, enabling your guild members to fight the members of the opposing guild without activating the forced PvP mode.When you get killed during a guild war, no further penalty will be applied and you will be given the option to resurrect by using an Elion's tear, resurrect at the closest safe zone, or resurrect at the closest town.

– Team Battle An arena where you can fight as a team for multiple rounds.Typically, the rounds are 1v1 duels. However, if the match ends in a tie, then the last deciding round will be team vs team.There are no penalties for dying in a team battle, however, it does count towards the result of the round.There is also a version of this where guilds can face off against other guilds. – Arena of Arsha An arena that can be operated by an Adventurer through the guild and host PvP matches. Unlike the Red Battlefield, you can invite the exact Adventurers you would like to participate in the matches, and have spectators.There are two modes in this arena, Team Match, and Team Survival Match. You, as the operator, can choose the mode and rules of the match.There are no penalties for dying in Team Battle, however, it does count towards the result of the round.

➤ You can read more about this feature in the [Arena of Arsha] page.

– Arena of Solare A seasonal matchmaking PvP content where Adventurers can participate in teams of 3 in a best of 5 rounds match.In the Arena of Solare, everyone uses equalized gear to participate in the matches. Points are given or taken depending on the results of the matches. There are rewards being prepared for participants that fight in the Arena of Solare depending on their results (points) over a period of time.The Ranked Mode can only be entered solo, while the practice rounds allow a premade team of up to 3.

➤ You can read more about this feature in the [Arena of Solare] page.



◈ Penalized PvP
All Adventurers in the world of Black Desert have the option to force PvP after a certain level. However since it is forced, penalties may apply.

– Forced PvPAny character that is Lv. 50 or higher can press the command Alt + C to force PvP on other Adventurers.When activated, you will be able to attack any Adventurer that is not in your party, platoon, or guild.Attacking other Adventurers in this manner may result in you losing karma.(However, if you are defending yourself against another Adventurer that attacks you first with forced PvP, or attacking an Adventurer with negative karma, you will not lose karma.)* Deal the first blow: Karma -3,000 * Kill an Adventurer: Karma -50,000 to -120,000 * On season servers forced PvP is not possible.* On Arsha (PvP servers) attacking or killing Adventurers does not cause loss of karma.

If your characters have negative karma, then the guards in towns will come to attack you.There are various penalties applied to characters that die with negative karma, such as the chance to drop enhancement levels on their gear.


➤ Please check the [Karma] and [Death Penalties] pages for more details on this mechanic.

– FugitivesThe desert is a lawless region. Additionally to the loss of karma, you also will become a “fugitive” for 30 minutes if you force-PvP, attack and kill another Adventurer.When you become a fugitive, you can be attacked even if your karma is above 0 and when you don’t have forced PvP activated. Also, fugitives killed by other Adventurers will be sent to jail.

To leave jail you must either work to repay for your crime, or try to escape by dodging between the guards.

You will no longer be marked as a fugitive once the 30 minutes elapse or when you go to jail. However, you will continue to be seen as a fugitive if you die outside of the desert.

Subtópico: Karma
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
In Black Desert, all characters possess karma. If you kill other Adventurers, wild horses, or other protected fauna, or you’re caught stealing from an NPC, your family’s karma will decrease. This is shown as a numerical value that can be checked in your character’s profile, in the My Info window (hotkey: P).
However, it does not mean that you cannot fight back against other Adventurers attacking you. You can counterattack using the PvP system that is applied when someone attacks you first.
If another Adventurer attacks you first, that character will be displayed in red and a knife-shaped icon will appear next to the character's name.The character who attacks first will have their family karma decreased by 10,000 points, but if the character attacks again within the 3 minutes given as self-defense time, their karma will not continue decreasing.Regardless of whether or not a counterattack occurs, if the character kills the opponent, their karma will be reduced by a minimum of 85,000 points, and to a maximum of 204,000 points, depending on the difference between their attack and defense values.The combined attack and defense values between characters are compared, and when a strong character kills a weak character, more karma is taken away from them.
A family's karma cannot go above 300,000 points, so if you kill at least two Adventurers, it will drop below 0.
Note that a character who has been attacked will not suffer any penalty even if they counterattack and kill the character who took the lead and initiated unsolicited combat.



As seen above, the character that attacked first appears in red.If you want to be the one attacking other Adventurers first, press the key combo Alt+C to activate the PvP mode. That said, if you’re the one receiving an unsolicited attack from another Adventurer, you can defend yourself without switching to PvP mode.

◈ Consequences of Negative Karma
If your family’s karma decreases below 0, several penalties will be applied to them.

– The town guards in almost every city and post will become hostile to you, and attack you on sight.– Your characters’ names will appear in red, and other Adventurers will be able to attack you.– You will lose more Combat EXP than normal when dying while possessing negative karma.– There is an increased chance of magic crystals breaking when dying.– There is a certain chance for your equipment to have its enhancement level decrease upon death. However, enhancement level loss and magic crystal loss will not happen simultaneously.

In addition to the above, dying in the desert, a generally lawless area, with negative karma will soften up the penalties applied to your characters.

◈  How to Recover Karma
A family’s karma is recovered by defeating any kind of monster commonly found throughout Black Desert’s world, except for those that cause your karma to decrease (wild horses and protected fauna).

Subtópico: Death Penalties
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
If a character dies, there is a death penalty depending on what caused the death.

If you die fighting monsters, you may experience a decrease in combat EXP, destruction of magic crystals, and destruction of trade goods.In particular, magic crystals are easily destroyed, so you should always be careful.The combat EXP loss can also become a notable burden once you’ve leveled up enough, so always keep it in mind and pay attention.

No death penalty is applied for a death caused during PvP, unless the character involved possesses negative karma.




When your character dies, you can select a resurrection location.If you don’t choose a location within the 10-minute waiting time, it resurrects automatically depending on the situation.

If you have revival items such as ‘Elion’s Tear,’ and check it for use, you’ll see the combat EXP is restored. The same is not applied to destroyed magic crystals and trade goods.


◈ Instant Resurrection
If you have an Elion’s tear, you can resurrect on the exact spot.In the arena, you can resurrect immediately on the spot even without this item.However, if you die in a conquest area or in the water, you can’t use the item.

Elion’s tears can be obtained from events, certain challenges, season content, and crafted via simple alchemy (hotkey: L) with Mystical Spirit Powder x100 and Tears of War x1.


◈ Resurrect at the Closest Town
You resurrect from a town that is closest to the node where you died.If there is no town that has been discovered in the same territory, you will be resurrected from the closest town possible.


◈ Resurrect at the Closest Safe Zone
You will be resurrected at the nearest node within the territory of the area where you died. The node must be already discovered.Characters with negative karma may be resurrected at undiscovered nodes, and will respawn at one of the three nearby nodes, at random.Additionally, keep in mind that if there is no node within a certain distance, this menu option may not be available.


◈ Conquest War Resurrection
Only Conquest War participants have this option displayed. Resurrect near the stronghold or command post you belong to during the conflict.




Your family karma value decreases when you do actions that harm others, such as stealing from NPCs or unilaterally killing other Adventurers, and increases when you kill monsters.

If you counterattack and kill an opponent who first flagged up (activated PvP mode) and attacked you, it is recognized as self-defense and does not affect your karma, but otherwise, it is recognized as player-killing and your karma is decreased.

If you preemptively attack another Adventurer by activating PvP mode yourself, your karma will decrease by 10,000 points, and if you kill them, it will decrease by 200,000 points.Therefore, if you kill an opponent who did not counterattack, you will lose a total of 210,000 karma.

It should be noted that karma cannot be raised above 300,000, so if you kill more than 2 Adventurers in a row, it will drop below 0 and you will be severely penalized.

If your karma continues to go down, it becomes negative (negative karma), and various penalties are applied to your characters.


◈ Attacked in a Safe Zone
Negative karma Adventurers can be attacked even in safe zones, such as towns, and receive a death penalty upon death.


◈ Enhanced Death Penalty
When a negative karma character dies, more equipment magic crystals are destroyed, or their enhancement levels are reduced.However, as with the normal penalty, enhancement level reduction, and magic crystal destruction do not apply at the same time, and the enhancement level reduction cannot occur while in the Valencian desert.


◈ Resurrection Spot
If you select to resurrect at a node when possessing negative karma, you will be resurrected in one of the three nearest nodes, regardless of territory or exploration status.


◈ Attacked by NPCs
The guard NPCs guarding the different towns will attack negative karma characters on sight.Since the guards roam around the towns as well as their borders, it becomes difficult to use the usual town functionalities while suffering from these penalties.That said, you will not be attacked by guards in the bandit haven of Muiquun.




In desert areas, such as within the eponymous Black Desert, if you kill another Adventurer even if you don't have negative karma, you will become a fugitive for 30 minutes and receive a penalty similar to the negative karma status.

Even if you do not activate PvP, you can be attacked by other Adventurers even if your karma is 0 or higher. This is due to the desert’s lawless status.

If you are killed by a monster/environment, you only receive the penalty of broken magic crystals and reduced combat experience.


As seen above, killing another Adventurer while in the desert will show everybody around you your new status as a fugitive.

The mark disappears after 30 minutes, or if you move to the jail, but remember that dying in a non-desert area will not remove the mark.

If you leave the desert area, you will receive the disadvantages according to your karma.For this reason, it is important to check frequently to make sure that your karma has not fallen below 0 and that you are not out of the desert area.

Note that trade goods can be destroyed at a certain chance regardless of karma or region.

If a negative karma Adventurer is killed by other Adventurers or NPCs in the desert area, they are forcibly sent to jail, and a punishment debuff is applied.To leave jail you must either work to repay for your crime, or try to escape by dodging between the guards.

You will no longer be marked as a fugitive once the 30 minutes elapse or when you go to jail. However, you will continue to be seen as a fugitive if you die outside of the desert.

If you receive a punishment debuff, all combat actions are limited, movement speed is reduced by 50%, mounts cannot be summoned, and the escape option from the main menu will not move you outside jail.
If you are killed by NPCs or other Adventurers while in there, you can only resurrect in the jail, and you will not be further penalized.However, you will be restricted from using content such as the Red Battlefield and horse racing, guild gathering orders, guild fort creation, and the horse’s flute.Due to these limited actions and movements, it is recommended that you exit/escape the jail as quickly as possible while under the punishment buff.

There are two ways to get out of the prison camp.NPCs are placed at each entrance and exit of the place, and inside, a guard NPC is attacking and monitoring.In order to escape the camp, you can complete the quest through the entrance NPC to remove the punishment buff, or you can avoid the guard NPC's surveillance and run to the exit to escape.

If the quest you already received from the jail is in progress, you cannot escape even if the punishment buff is removed, so you must complete or abandon the quest before attempting to escape.

If you complete the quest given by the jail entrance NPC or successfully escape by avoiding the prison guard NPC, Adventurers with a karma of 0 or higher will be moved directly to Ibellab Oasis, and Adventurers with -1 or lower will be moved to the bandit haven of Muiquun.




Naval fame increases by killing sea monsters, and decreases by pre-empting or destroying other Adventurers’ ships.

If your naval fame drops below 0, you become a pirate and will be attacked by the coastal guard NPCs on each town’s wharf.Additionally, if you are killed by another character or NPC, you may receive the following disadvantages:

1. Upon death, magic crystals and lightstones may be destroyed.2. An item’s enhancement level may decrease.

Finally, most wharf managers cannot be interacted with while you’re a pirate, and supplying your ship is only available from the wharf manager of the Kuit Islands, Gapur.

Subtópico: Node War
Conteúdo do Subtópico:

Node War is RvR content where guilds (and alliances) compete against each other for control over various nodes scattered throughout the Black Desert world.

The nodes that serve as the stage for Node War belong to different territories: Balenos, Serendia, Calpheon, Mediah, Valencia, and Kamasylvia.

Node Wars take place from 9:00 PM to 11:00 PM every day except for Saturdays when Conquest Wars are held. Each day has designated nodes available for participation. Furthermore, each node has unique tiers ranging from tier 1 to tier 4, which impose restrictions on the maximum number of participants and their stats.

To find out which regions in the Black Desert host Node Wars, as well as the tiers and days on which Node Wars are held, you can click on the "Node War Information" button located in the top right corner of the world map.

Below is a table summarizing the schedule and participant limits for each node tier.
Consider the number of available participants and the average equipment level of guild members to participate in Node Wars at an appropriate level and experience the thrill of intense battles.
If victorious in Node War, you can acquire the accumulated taxes from the corresponding node as a basic reward. The higher the node tier, the greater the amount of taxes.
Additionally, you can make use of the War Vendor specific to each node tier and obtain individual victory rewards. Even if you do not achieve victory in Node War, participation alone can earn you rewards.
Please refer to section 3, “Node War Victory/Participation Rewards,” in this guide for detailed information on the participation rewards.

Once you have purchased a fort, you need to construct it within the Node War area of the desired node you wish to participate in.

First, decide which node area you want to build the fort in.

To construct the fort, you need to go to the appropriate server with the same name as the territory where the node is located. You can find out which servers are available for building the fort by checking the Node War schedule for that day.

For example, if the node belongs to Balenos, you can build the fort on the Balenos 1 server, and the Node War will also take place on that server.
Once you have moved to the appropriate server for building the fort, you can right-click on the fort item to install it. Fort installation takes one hour to complete. If the installation is not yet complete, you can also cancel the installation. However, cancellation is not possible if there is less than one hour remaining until the start of the Node War or if it has already begun.
Has the fort installation been successfully completed? If so, guild members/alliance members can apply to participate in the Node War by clicking the "Participate" button in the Guild menu (G).
Each annex has a designated maximum number of installations. Therefore, it is important to assess which annexes are necessary for the current Node War and where it is best to install them.

You can find detailed explanations of each annex in the "Annex Guide."
The objective of the Node War is clear: protect your own fort and destroy the enemy's fort.
Discuss strategies with guild members and faithfully carry out assigned missions to achieve your objective.

Utilize various annexes and assign roles such as assault teams and defense teams. Develop strategies and aim for victory in the Node War.
If all forts of other guilds/alliances participating in the same node are destroyed, and your guild/alliance fort remains intact, you achieve victory in the Node War.

Alternatively, if the guild/alliance that occupied the node in the previous week participates in the same node again and their fort is not destroyed until the end of the Node War, it results in a successful defense and victory in the Node War.

If two or more forts remain at the end of the Node War, the node will be liberated. When a node is liberated, all forts and annexes are automatically demolished.
If a guild/alliance has successfully captured the node in the Node War, their fort will remain intact, while the annexes will be demolished. All forts and annexes of other guilds/alliances will be demolished as well.

When adventurers and their guilds participate in the intense battles of Node War or emerge victorious to claim a node, they are rewarded with glorious spoils!

Brace yourselves for the bountiful rewards that await:
When a guild wins a Node War, they receive the accumulated taxes from that node as guild funds. The taxes can be acquired immediately upon capturing the node, and the higher the node tier, the higher the percentage of taxes that can be obtained.

View the Tax Acquisition Rate by Node Tier

Adventurers receive appropriate reward items based on the tier of the node they participated in and the results of the Node War. However, rewards can only be obtained if the minimum requirements for guild/alliance in the Node War are met (such as destroying enemy forts, achieving a total of 50 or more kills/deaths, etc.).

The reward items consist of Gold Bars, Resplendent Medal of Honor, Essence of Honor/Gallantry, and other items that aid your adventures. Click below for detailed information on each reward item.

Common Rules for Node/Conquest Wars

Node Wars offer various benefits and rewards, but it's also an opportunity to experience the thrill of guild-scale group PvP and build strong bonds with guild members.
Even if your gear may not be exceptional, you can participate in the appropriate tier of Node Wars and engage in intense battles. Additionally, you can make use of various siege weapons such as cannons, Hwacha, and flame towers to showcase your skills.

Subtópico: Arena of Solare
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
Long ago, when Calpheon and Valencia had just discovered the other, they held a friendly bout in an arena where both brutes and refined knights fought one another. Currently, there exists no trace of the tournament, as it has all but disappeared from the annals of history. Its name was the Arena of Solare.

The Arena of Solare is 3 vs 3 match-type PvP content that you can enjoy without having to worry about differences in equipment (gear) specs.

In Ranked Mode, your overall ranking points will increase on wins, and decrease on losses.

During your fights, you will earn “Seals of Solare" which can be used to unlock new gear, magic crystals, and other items available in Arena of Solare.

Ranked Matches can only be entered during specific windows of time as highlighted below.
Note that, in ranked matches, a team composed of three of the same class is not possible.
For those wishing to just practice their skills, the Practice Mode is the Arena of Solare without the added pressure of ranking points. Although you will not gain “Seals of Solare” for a win in Practice Mode, you also will not lose anything in case your team cannot overcome the odds.

During practice mode, you will also be able to see your opponent's defense effects (Super Armor, Forward Guard, etc) displayed above their heads. You can also create parties of 2 or 3 other Adventurers and jump into the action of Arena of Solare together during practice mode.

In practice mode, a team composed of three of the same class is possible.

You can participate in the Arena of Solare from Lv. 60 with a character that has completed their Succession/Awakening questlines. Both season and non-season characters can participate.

You can use the Arena of Solare menu by going to the main menu (hotkey: Esc) → War (F7).

As mentioned above, Ranked Mode is only available during certain times, while Practice Mode is available outside of these times.
This is the schedule when you can queue up for Arena of Solare Regular Season Matches:
In addition to equipping exclusive gear, you can also select crystals you want to slot into your gear.

Early on, you have access to basic gear and magic crystals. You can later use "Seals of Solare" that you get once a match ends to unlock a variety of other gear and crystals.

Press [Find Match] on the Arena of Solare menu with your arena-exclusive gear loadout set to begin auto-matching.You will automatically enter the battlefield if all 6 participants accept once matching is complete.





In the Arena of Solare, you will not only be provided with equalized gear, but you will be restricted from using potions, meals, elixirs, etc. Your character’s recovery effects, AP, DP, Accuracy, and Evasion stats will each be applied according to a set ratio.

The following set of rules will additionally be applied in the Arena of Solare.



Please note that the availability of the battlefields may vary.


◈ Olun's Valley

◈ Dokkebi Cave
A foggy and quiet battlefield where Water’s Chill appears in the center of the field at certain times.




◈ Gowun Plateau Reed Field
A battlefield of lush reeds where Wind’s Song appears in various places on the field at certain times.




◆ Elemental Traces

They spawn in places within the arenas. Upon destroying them, you can obtain boons from each of the elements.You and party members nearby can receive the effects of these elemental boons (excluding Wind’s Song).10 seconds before the elemental traces appear, a light effect will indicate the spot where they will appear.

– Flora’s Breath: Recovers HP.



– Water’s Chill: Increases All DP for 30 seconds.



– Fire’s Warmth: Increases All AP for 20 seconds.



– Wind’s Song: Increases Attack/Casting/Movement Speed by 25% for 30 seconds. However, you cannot share the buff with your party.



Tip!
Elemental trace buffs obtained on the battlefield will be displayed as an icon above your character’s head.


You can earn more points the longer you maintain a winning streak.

For Adventurers that reach the higher ranks, they will be deducted points depending on their rank if they do not participate in matches for a set period of time.
• Solare Incarnate [V]: If you do not participate in matches for 5 days, you will lose 30 points for each day afterward.• Radiant Spear [IV]: If you do not participate in matches for 7 days, you will lose 20 points for every 3 days afterward.• Twilight Spear [III]: If you do not participate in matches for 14 days, you will lose 15 points for every 7 days afterward.

For example, if you played your final match on January 1st after achieving Solar Incarnate [V], points will be deducted 5 days later (following January 2-6) on January 7th.


You can also view the top 20 ranked Adventurers by class by selecting "Class" in the top right corner of the ranking UI.



➤ For more information on knockdown, down smash, super armor, and other offensive effects, please check the [PvP] page.



Characters of Adventurers who have ranked 1st in each class in the official Arena of Solare season will be made into NPCs and placed in the Battle Arena.

Adventurers who ranked among the top 100 in the official Arena of Solare season will receive the Solare Knight Outfit Box via in-game mail (hotkey: B). Open the box with the character you wish to obtain the Solare Knight Outfit.



At the same time, also via in-game mail the same Adventurers will receive the title “Solare Knight.” To obtain the item, right-click on the title item attached to the letter.This title can be used until the end of the following official season of Arena of Solare.

Subtópico: Arena of Arsha
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
The Arena of Arsha is where guild masters can host their own PVP tournaments.

A guild master can reserve the arena for a day by opening the Arena of Arsha window in the main menu (hotkey: Esc).The guild master can then invite Adventurers to the arena and have them fight in either a team match or survival mode.

The arena is reserved using guild funds.However, any Adventure with an invitation can enter the arena, regardless of the guild they are in.

The arena is different from Red Battlefield and other large-scale battles, as Adventurers can form teams with other Adventurers beforehand, and the host can set the rules such as time limit, victory conditions, and other details.

Spectators cannot participate directly but are free to watch.





Operation rights are required to host an Arena of Arsha match.Only guild masters, their advisors, and guild staff can get operation rights.

The first step is to select a day.Access the Arena of Arsha window by going to the main menu → War (F7) → Arena of Arsha. The Arena of Arsha window will come up with an explanation about how to make a reservation and the reservation status. The options to make the reservation will only appear to the guild ranks with permission to host a match: Guild Master, Advisor, and Staff.

You can use the arena for the whole day once you successfully reserve it.The reservation fee is 10 million silver from your guild funds. You may cancel the reservation at any time, but you won’t get a refund.



Go to the Arena of Arsha window to see the reservation status on the server you are in. You can pick whichever day you want as long as another guild didn’t reserve it yet.

The Arena of Arsha operates separately on each server.If the date you want isn’t available on the current server, try looking on a different server.

However, please note that the arena isn’t available on servers that hold Conquest Wars (Serendia - 1, Calpheon - 1, Mediah - 1, Valencia - 1, Balenos - 1).

You must claim your operation rights on the day you reserved it. Open the Guild window (hotkey: G) and then click on the ‘Host AOA’ button on the main page. It’s impossible to transfer or return your operation rights.



You can enter and set up the arena once you have obtained your operation rights.After this, you can invite other Adventurers and set the match rules.



You will see the Arena of Arsha Settings window if you open once again the Arena of Arsha window through the main menu while you’re inside the arena.This is where you can invite other Adventurers. You can promote an invited Adventurer to a suboperator.Suboperators can invite and remove Adventurers from the arena.Right-click on the character name then click on ‘Promote’ to give the Adventurer suboperation rights.

If you invite an Adventurer after clicking on ‘Invite Spectator,’ then the Adventurer can enter as a spectator and will not go to the waiting list.If you invite an Adventurer after clicking on ‘Invite Suboperator,’ then the Adventurer can enter the arena with suboperator rights.

Adventurers can switch back to the waiting list before the match starts.

You can restrict participants and spectators from entering the arena by clicking on the lock in the top left corner of the settings window.No one can enter the arena once you click on this lock, including Adventurers with invitations.



Above, from the operator’s view, right-click on the character name to either, remove, promote, or change their teams.

Operators, suboperators, and invitees can enter the arena and move around freely, but their skills will be restricted. Adventurers cannot see characters other than their own.When the match starts, you can only see yourself and other participants in the match.

Adventurers invited as spectators can only spectate the match from the spectator’s bench.

After placing all the Adventurers into their teams, you can now start setting the rules.You can set the matches as ‘Team Match’ or ‘Team Survival Match’.Team Match has 2 teams fight each other while in Team Survival Match you can have multiple teams fight each other to be the last ones standing.

• General Rules- Once you enter the arena, all buffs (food, elixirs, furniture effects, etc.) will be removed and your Black Spirit’s Rage will be set to 0%.- Buffs that are gained from character skills can be used.- Both normal potions and battlefield-exclusive potions can be used.- Both Black Spirit’s Rage and Emergency Escape will be reset each round.- The effects of reducing maximum HP and HP recovery over time are applied, and as a result, you cannot recover more than the reduced maximum HP.- In individual battles, the maximum HP reduction effect is applied to Adventurers who have won consecutive victories. The higher the number of victories, the greater the strength of the maximum life reduction effect received in the next battle.- When the time limit runs out, the winner is decided by the sum of the HP % of all remaining team members. • Team Match (Round)- Participants are split into 2 teams.- The team that wipes out the opposing team wins the round.- Characters that die during the round cannot be resurrected until the round ends.- The team that reaches the target score first wins.- Participants are teleported to the starting point in the arena before the match starts.- At the end of each round, all participants are resurrected and teleported to their starting point.- Once the match is over, the results are announced and all participants previously killed are resurrected. • Team Survival Match (Free For All)- Several teams fight at the same time.- Teams that survive the match wins.- As long as a single member of a team survives, the team is counted to have survived.- There is only one round. You cannot be resurrected until the end of the match if you die.- The arena operator sets the victory condition (number of surviving teams). For example, if the victory condition is set to ‘2 teams left standing,’ then the match continues until there are only two teams left.

• Individual Battle (Team Battle)- Divided into two teams, each team member participates in a 1:1 battle.- The operator can set one of each team member as the captain.- When the match starts, the captain of each team has 30 seconds to select a team member to participate in the match.- If you do not select a team member to compete, one of the team members will automatically participate.- The character who won the 1:1 battle can continue fighting.- The team that no longer has survivors and can no longer send out players loses.

Once you assign teams and set the rule, it’s time to start the match.Just click on ‘Start Match’ and the participants will get a message saying that the match will start after 20 seconds of prep time.

For Team Match, participants will be teleported to their starting positions at the start of the match.Participants can buy battlefield-exclusive potions and repair their equipment at their starting position through NPCs.

For Team Survival Match, participants will be teleported into the arena where they are free to move around. They won’t have time to buy or repair anything in this mode so participants need to be prepared before the operator starts the match.



Participants will be teleported to either one of these locations at the start of the match.


You can buy potions or repair your equipment through the AOA Guard NPCs.

Participants will have their team indicated above their heads after the 20-second prep time.HP of participants is shown on the left side of the screen.The winners are decided by the rules set by the operator.The next round will automatically start after 20 seconds of prep time.You can see the current score and the time left in the match in the middle of the screen.

When 1/3 of the match time has elapsed, if the current health is 80% or more of the maximum health, the health is reduced by the amount exceeding 80%.The recovery rate of health potions and health restoration skills is reduced by 80%, and you cannot recover more than 80% of your maximum health.

When 2/3 of the match time has elapsed, if the current health is 50% or more of the maximum health, the health is reduced by the amount exceeding 50%.The amount recovered by health potions and health recovery skills is reduced by 50%, and you cannot heal more than 50% of your maximum health.

Operators can stop a match that's in progress.They can resurrect all participants that had died by clicking ‘Resurrect All’.



Each character will have a team name marked above their head once the match starts. The current score and the time left in the match are visible in the middle of the screen.

Subtópico: Battle Arena
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
In the battle arena you will not receive any penalties (decrease in combat experience, magic crystal destruction, trade good destruction, etc.) due to character death, nor karma loss from defeating other Adventurers, so you can enjoy PvP with your opponents without worrying about these things.

Unlike other areas where you have to press “Alt+C” to activate PvP, here PvP is enabled by default within the combat zone of the arena. However, party members of the same party are excluded and cannot attack each other.

In addition to a free-for-all location for combat, the battle arena also has several NPCs to assist you, such as a skill instructor to help you with your character’s skills, a quartermaster to purchase cheap battle arena-only potions from, a vendor for trial characters, and the arena manager to enter 1:1 combat rounds.

Drill sergeants and wooden scarecrows are placed throughout the arena so that you can practice your skills and study how they work against both PvE monster enemies and human PvP enemies.

The wooden scarecrows are not subject to skill effects (stun, stiffness, knockdown, bound, etc.), but the drill sergeants are subject to them. This way you can practice your skills with or without taking these effects into account.

Practicing with the drill sergeants displays hit detection effects such as down attack, back attack, critical hits, etc.Additionally, you’ll find that several of these drill sergeants are differentiated by their training level: beginner, intermediate, and advanced. Depending on their level, they’ll react differently to your attacks.

It is recommended to practice here to build up your own combat flow and combos so you can then use them outside the battle arena.

In the battle arena, you can use normal potions to restore your character’s health, but you can also purchase and use the exclusive potions purchased from NPC Robb, the quartermaster, for the low price of 1 silver per unit. It goes without saying that, once you’re outside the battle arena, these potions become unusable.

You can find the quartermaster, Robb, in the middle of the arena.

For future reference, these actions, such as leaning against a wall or sitting on a bench or railing can be used in spaces other than the battle arena.

➤ You can read more about it on the [Observer Mode & Photo Mode] page.
Adventurers who are not yet equipped with weapons and armor can create a trial character and enter the battle arena.

Trial characters can purchase equipment boxes that include high enhancement level weapons, defense gear, and accessories through NPC Haz.

You can have 3 trial characters per family. Skill points for them are provided, so you can directly experience and check all the character classes you want without any prior game time.
Furthermore, trial characters can also participate in the Red Battlefield PvP mode, which allows for a good experience to show off the skills you have honed in the battle arena.However, note that travel outside of the battle arena and the red battlefield is not possible for trial characters.

➤ If you want to know more about trial characters, the red battlefield, and the basics of PvP, please check the [Red Battlefield], [Trial Character], and [PvP] pages.

Subtópico: Town Arena
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
These duel arenas are places where you can enjoy straightforward PvP content.They are usually located next to major towns, and anyone can participate just by entering and facing any other Adventurer who steps into the combat area.Even if you are in the same guild, level 50 or lower, PvP is enabled within these areas.

The biggest feature of the town arenas is that there is no death penalty of any kind. This way, you can experience PvP without worry because there is no penalty for killing others: No loss of Combat EXP and destruction of magic crystals for dying, loss of karma, etc.

These arenas can be found right outside Velia (Balenos), Heidel (Serendia), Calpheon (Calpheon), and Valencia City (Valencia).


Note that the arena in Altinova is located in the middle of the city and is a combat area by default. Due to this, you need to flag up for PvP to fight other Adventurers in it, or challenge them to a duel. However, keep in mind that penalties will be applied.

Subtópico: Red Battlefield
Conteúdo do Subtópico:

The battlefield has a variety of areas you can fight in, such as the capital of Valencia where points are acquired by occupying areas, and Garmoth's Nest and Castle Ruins which play in a team deathmatch format.

The rules of each battlefield can be checked through the Red Battlefield Rules section on the right when you hover your cursor over the Enter button.

Upon entering the Red Battlefield, characters are automatically assigned to one of the two opposing teams: the Black Desert or the Red Desert camps.

If at least one character is assigned to each team, the Red Battlefield will begin after a brief preparation time.

In this format, the Red Battlefield is a 20-minute battle between two factions.You can join up to 10 minutes after the match has started, but not after this time has passed.If this happens, you have to wait for the battle to end and a new one to start again.

When the battle begins, participants are moved to the red battlefield area.If you leave the red battlefield area or the game closes, you will be moved to the original location you were in before.At this point, if this happened 10 minutes before the battle started, you can rejoin the battle in progress.

During the time limit, you can freely deal with the enemies of the opposite faction as you like.
Points accumulated until the end of the match are added up, and the side with the highest score wins.

Points are earned when you defeat a character from the opposing faction.The number of points acquired depends on the number of points possessed by the defeated character.There are no special restrictions when respawning in the Red Battlefield.It's better not to be afraid of death and actively enjoy combat.


You can use any of the potions you have at the Red Battlefield, but it will be much cheaper to use the potions that the Quartermaster NPC within the battlefield sells.

The price of each potion is just 1 silver, and they only weigh 0,01LT.

Also, if you interact with the Quartermaster NPC in the Garmoth’s Nest battlefield, a button that says ‘Effect of Strong Protection’ appears. When you click this, you’ll get the Evasion Up and Damage Reduction Increase effects for about 20 seconds. (You’ll be almost invincible for 20 seconds, since it’s very powerful)

This buff is applied automatically when entering the Castle Ruins and Valencia City battlefields.
This NPC will also give you daily and weekly quests.

The Combat & Skill EXP will be automatically applied once the battle ends.The silver and token rewards are sent to your Black Spirit’s Safe (hotkey: B).

If you have collected a certain number of battlefield tokens, you can exchange them for rewards.If you collect 50 tokens, you can exchange them for Red Essence through Ornella, the arms dealer of Heidel.(If you have the 'Red Seal' item, which is an old reward item, you can exchange them for Red Essence with 80 of them.)

If you heat (hotkey: L) Red Essence with certain magic crystals, you can obtain red battlefield crystals.

This page centers around the Valencia City battlefield for Red Battlefield. For information regarding the other battlefields available, please check the [Red Battlefield] page.

Red Battlefield: Valencia is in the heart of the city at the desert’s edge in the world of Black Desert. As such, there are environmental obstacles like houses, roofs, stairs, and other objects found in an urban setting. Be sure to make a note of them and take advantage of them whenever possible.

The Valencia City battlefield does not follow the same rules as the pre-existing battlefield where you kill opponents to earn points for your team.There are areas within the field for your team to occupy. Your team will have to keep the area occupied to earn points.Therefore, you can be influential to your team’s victory, even if you do not own high-end gear, by leading your team strategically on the battlefield.

Once each team has at least 1 Adventurer, the battle will begin after a short prep time. (Adventurers can enter the Red Battlefield in the first 10 minutes of the battle, but it will be locked after 10 min has elapsed.)

The battle goes for 20 minutes. Each team can try to occupy the areas during that time. There are a total of 5 areas that can be occupied. One occupied area gives 1 point per second.You can differentiate each area’s occupation status by their color.

Construction tips and details on the functions of each annex!
To participate in Node and Conquest Wars, it is important not only to construct forts but to also build annexes. Each annex has a different function and role, so you can utilize them to take down enemy forts more effectively.

However, there is a limit on occupiable grids and number of annexes that can be built depending on the Node War tier or the type of fort being used in a Conquest War. Thus, it is important to strategize which annex to build as you establish your fort.

Now, let’s have a look at the roles and functions of each annex.

Conquest War is large-scale PvP content between Guilds/Alliances competing for supremacy over the territories of Calpheon, Mediah, or Valencia.

This guide will provide a complete walkthrough on Conquest Wars
Conquest Wars start every Saturday at 8:00 PM and are i hours long by default. Time is added every time a defensive gate is destroyed, and the duration of a Conquest War can be extended to be up to 4 hours. .

To participate in Conquest Wars, Guilds/Alliances must have occupied at least one node.You must have participated in a Node War during a Sunday-Friday of that week, occupied at least one node, and installed a Field HQ or Command Post 1 hour prior to the start of the Conquest War.

* Additional benefits for each territory may vary periodically.

Guild members can participate in Conquest Wars by pressing the participation button in the guild window (G).


▲ A guild or alliance can have a maximum of 100 members.


If a Conquest War has begun, the nature of the battle will progress differently depending on whether there is a defending side or not.

If there is no defending guild present, the conditions for victory remain the same as Node Wars. Destroying all Field HQs or Command Posts of other guilds/alliances while ensuring that your own Field HQ or Command Post remains intact will lead to your victory.
However, if there are two or more guilds remaining at the end of the Conquest War, it does not result in liberation like in Node Wars. Instead, the guild/alliance that obtains a higher score through the point system will be declared winner and occupy the territory.

- The following point-based system will be applied if there is no defending guild/alliance present and there are two or more guilds/alliances remaining at the end of the Conquest War.

* The top 5 guilds/alliances at the end of the Conquest War (minus the one that emerges as Lord), based on this point system will receive the Burning Spirit Reward based on their rankings.- When the point system is applied, rewards will be obtained differentially based on the elapsed battle time.* Guilds/alliances whose Command Posts/Field HQs are destroyed within the first hour after the start of the Conquest War can obtain a Fighting Spirit Reward (Gold Bars worth 150,000,000 Silver, Resplendent Medal of Honor x10).* Guilds/alliances whose Command Posts/Field HQs were destroyed after the first hour receive w least a Burning Inspiration Reward (Gold Bars worth 250,000,000 Silver, Resplendent Medal of Honor x36). Ranking will be determined based on the time of destruction.
* If there are fewer than 6 guilds/alliances remaining at the end of the Conquest War, rewards are given based on the order of destruction of Command Posts/Field HQs


If there is a defending guild, the attacking guilds will join forces to attack the Fort of the defending guild.In this case, the initial duration of a Conquest War is 20:00 to 22:00, lasting for 2 hours. However, if the first gate, known as the Outer Gate, is destroyed, 30 minutes are added to the total duration.

2. If a guild or alliance successfully destroys the buildings of all other guilds or alliances before the end of a Conquest War
* In the event that a Conquest War ends based on the point system, the guild/alliance that rank in the top 5 guilds, (excluding the ruling guild) can receive higher-tier awards based on their ranking.Item Drop Rate Bonus
* The benefits of each territory are subject to periodic changes.
When becoming the lord of a territory, the guild will acquire the taxes collected from the territory as guild funds. Refer to the rules regarding taxes below.
- In a Conquest War, all guilds/alliances participating in the siege can plunder 2% of the scheduled tax collection amount accumulated in the territory every 10 minutes after the start of the Conquest War. They can plunder up to a maximum of 20%.
- As the consecutive weeks of occupation by the defending guild increase, the maximum amount of tax that can be plundered increases by 2% each week, up to a maximum of 30% after 5 weeks of consecutive occupation.
- The criteria for the amount of plundered tax is based on the time of destruction of the last guild/alliance's Command Post/Field HQ, and it is distributed equally among all participating guilds/alliances in the siege. (However, the plundered tax can only be obtained if the defending guild/alliance successfully defends the territory during the Conquest War.)
- In other words, if the title of lord taken by another guild/alliance that participated in the siege, the plundered tax cannot be obtained.
- When a guild/alliance is victorious in the Conquest War and occupies a territory, 50% of the accumulated tax in that territory during the first week of occupation will be used as security budget, and only the remaining 50% will be obtained.
- With consecutive occupations, the security budget decreases. When occupying the territory for more than 5 consecutive weeks, it is possible to obtain 100% of the accumulated tax amount in the territory.
- The guild/alliance that is victorious can obtain both the accumulated tax in the occupied node and individual victory rewards.

Subtópico: Life Skill Overview
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
In the world of Black Desert there are a variety of life skill activities that you can discover, relax in, and enjoy separately from the exciting combat you’ll become familiar with as soon as you create your first character.

All life skill activities are closely related, so even if you concentrate on one and challenge yourself to become a guru of it, you’ll inevitably end up naturally delving into others as soon as you explore the different options the game offers.


◈ The Basics
You can experience life skill activities while you are leveling the characters. However, in order to receive a life skill-related quest, you must toggle the quest preference for Life and Fishing quests at the bottom of the Quests window (hotkey: O).If you do not check these types of quests to be visible, you will not be able to receive a quest even if you talk to the correct NPC to obtain it.



After this is done, you can summon the Black Spirit (hotkey: ,) and access the Guide option.There you can press the [I want to learn ~] options. The navigation guide will guide you to the place where you can obtain the quest, and the text will tell you its requirements.



Of course, you can simply go and for example buy a gathering tool from an NPC shop and start gathering, even if you don’t do any of the life skill introductory quests.You can start any life skill activity at any time, as long as you know how to perform it.

Life skill activities allow you to experience several aspects of the world, provide a way to earn silver, give compensation for combat and contribution EXP, and reward useful items. However, if you think you do not need help to complete the quest, you can buy your own tools and step into production.


◈ Types of Life Skill Activities

Type
Description
Gathering
The most basic life skill activity.
Depending on the desired resource, different gathering tools need to be used.
As the quality of the tool increases, the time needed for gathering is reduced.
Higher levels of this activity will decrease the energy consumed when performing it.
For more information, please check the [Gathering] page.
Fishing
You can catch fish by using fishing rods.
If your fishing level goes up, you can equip more kinds of fishing rods, and you can catch more types of fish.
For more information, please check the [Fishing] page.
Hunting
There are many types of wild animals one can hunt throughout Black Desert’s world.
As your hunting level rises, you can equip better matchlocks for hunting.
For more information, please check the [Hunting] page.
Cooking
In order to prepare dishes, you need to install a cooking utensil in your residence.
You can make a variety of dishes with ingredients and seasonings.
As your cooking level increases, you can prepare a wider variety of dishes.
For more information, please check the [Cooking] page.
Alchemy

To conduct alchemy, you must install an alchemy tool in your residence.
It is recommended that you try to secure enough ingredients through gathering or processing before, since alchemy is a difficult study.
As your alchemy level increases, you can prepare a wider variety of elixirs.
For more information, please check the [Alchemy] page.
Processing
This activity transforms acquired items by changing their shape or properties.
There are several processing options, including shaking, grinding, chopping, drying, filtering, heating, repairing, simple alchemy and cooking, imperial cuisine and alchemy, guild processing, and manufacture.
Higher processing levels increase the number & type of items produced.
For more information, please check the [Processing] page.
Training
To advance in the training of mounts, you need to increase their level, train their skills, or capture wild horses.
The higher level of training, the easier it is to train a mount.
For more information, please check the [Training] page.
Trading
Trading is a commercial activity that involves buying and selling goods through trade managers located at nodes and towns.
Long-distance trade requires a large amount of contribution points, and the market prices are flexible, so you need a lot of preparation and investigation beforehand.
The higher the trading level, the more trade goods you have access to.
For more information, please check the [Trading] page.
Farming
You can prepare a garden by setting up fences, and in it you can plant seeds and harvest crops, or improve the quality of the crops you have planted.
You can also graze the cows in these gardens.
Higher levels of this activity will decrease the energy consumed when performing it.
For more information, please check the [Farming] page.
Sailing
This life skill activity can be seen as your expertise when sailing the high seas with a ship.
Higher levels will grant access to a wider variety of ship skills to use.
For more information, please check the [Sailing & Bartering] page.
Bartering
This activity is the art of exchanging trade goods at sea, obtaining better quality, more expensive, goods the more you exchange them.
Mainly used for profit and to obtain materials for ship upgrades.
For more information, please check the [Sailing & Bartering] page.


◈ Life Skills Levels
As the EXP obtained from performing life skill activities accumulates, the level of each life skill increases. For the most part, every 10 levels, the title that refers to the level changes.

For example, if you obtain additional EXP when you’ve reached the maximum EXP atBeginner Lv. 10, you will become Apprentice Lv. 1.

The life skill titles are the following, in order: Beginner, Apprentice, Skilled, Professional, Artisan, Master, and Guru.

As you advance through the levels of each life skill, you will receive rewards through completed challenges (hotkey: Y).

When you reach certain levels for each life skill, you unlock leap quests. You can go to the next level of that life skill without the need to do these quests, but they offer a good amount of EXP as a bonus for completing.




◈ Combination of Life Skills
As mentioned previously, each life skill is related to the others. An item obtained from fishing or gathering may need to be processed before being usable. Whenever you hunt, you also gather. The crops you obtain from farming are often ingredients for cooking and alchemy. What fish you obtain, you can sell to a trade manager, and sailing and bartering go hand in hand.

In particular, gathering and processing are closely related to cooking and alchemy as well.This is because the ingredients for both these life skills can be acquired, or made, through gathering and processing.

For example, in order to acquire high level processing items you need to obtain and process leather glaze and metal solvent, made through alchemy, together with other materials. However, you need to obtain certificates (knowledge) for processing such materials



Above you can see an example of how certain items involve several steps, often via multiple life skills, to be improved. The green boxes indicate gathering, the blue ones processing, and the orange one a mix of alchemy and processing.

Conteúdo do Subtópico:
Every crafting activity in Black Desert’s world begins from the collection of materials.There are many ways to collect these. Among them, collecting materials directly from nature itself is called gathering.

Not only is the natural environment of Black Desert visually appealing, but it also contains plenty of untapped natural resources.

Once you lose yourself in the world of gathering, what you once neglected in your daily walks –the grass, the trees, even the rocks – will now seem like a treasure trove.

Whenever you draw near an object that you can gather, you will see a prompt that allows you to interact with it.Press the hotkey for interaction (R) to collect materials from it. If you don’t see the interaction interface, it means that another Adventurer gathered it just recently. No need to fret! These are renewable resources, which means that you can start gathering materials in the same area again after a certain period of time has elapsed.

If you don’t have the necessary tools on you, the interface will let you know which tool is needed.Depending on the gathering tool you use, the type of materials you obtain will differ, even when gathering from the same object.From trees, you can collect items like logs or timber with a lumbering axe, or collect sap with a fluid collector. In the same way, there are gathering tools that can be used in more than one type of gatherable object. For example, the fluid collector you use on trees can also be used to gather the blood of animals you hunt.



In the case of butchering an animal, you can gather its materials via the Gathering prompt (hotkey: R) after looting all the items dropped (if any) from the animal you’ve killed or hunted.



As seen above, this way you will obtain gathering items. In this case, weasel meat from gathering a dead weasel with a butcher knife.



Depending on the target you are gathering from, you will sometimes need a tool.Depending on the items you gather, you can craft those into materials of higher value by processing them via other life skills.

What kind of gatherable resources are there in Black Desert, and what are the tools you can use? Also, what else can you obtain after gathering? Here’s a chart to answer those questions:

You can gather herbs and wild herbs with your bare hands. However, using a hoe will reward you with much better results.

Unlike other resources, water and desert sand are not gathered from a specific object, but from the environment. This means that you can keep gathering them from the appropriate terrain (water source such as a river or the sea, desert sand) without interruption.

Additionally, gathered resources are the ingredients for a variety of items you can craft as mentioned earlier. If you want to know the types of items you can craft with the gathered resources you have obtained, please refer to the Crafting Notes feature.You can open the Crafting Notes via the main menu (hotkey: Esc) → Information → Crafting Notes, or by pressing the Crafting Notes button on the top right of this Adventurer’s Guide (hotkey: F1) or Adventurer’s Board (hotkey: F2).



Check out the various items you can craft in the Crafting Notes!


◈ An Unexpected Gathering Resource Appeared!
When you gather, you sometimes may come across items that you didn’t expect to get. These include fairy powder that you can get from all gathering activities, traces useful for alchemists, and items usually sought after by Adventurers who want to accumulate wealth, such as Caphras stones and sharp/hard black crystal shards.What should you do if you do get these items?

Unless you need it for one of its few uses, you can just sell the fairy powder at an NPC shop without a second thought.Traces are rare and much sought-after ingredients for alchemy. We recommend storing them until you need to delve into synthetizing elixirs and other alchemical products yourself. Alternatively, if you’re sure you’ll never use them, you can sell them in the Central Market for a good amount of silver.

You can achieve a great profit by selling Caphras stones and sharp/hard black crystal shards in the Central Market. However, there’s a good reason for their high price. These items are materials needed by all Adventurers who own combat equipment of a certain level or higher, and are needed to improve this equipment, so there might come a time when you have to use these items yourself. As such, you need to put in some thought as to whether you’ll sell it on the Central Market, or perhaps keep them and build up a supply in preparation for later.



Life skill activities generally have 11 categories, including gathering, processing, cooking, training, alchemy, fishing, hunting, trading, farming, sailing, and bartering. All of these have levels of their own, and the higher the level, the more bonuses you can get when performing them. You can check the levels of your life skills, which differ by character, via your character profile (hotkey: P).



Press the Learn More button at the bottom for more details regarding the bonuses you receive at your current level with each life skill.

When you reach a higher level in gathering, you can equip higher-grade gathering tools. High-grade gathering tools have the basic effect of reducing the gathering time you spend on each gatherable object.



Also, upon reaching a higher level, the chance for you to gather without consuming energy increases, you can obtain better and rarer items, and your mastery level goes up. This will be explained more in detail, as the mastery level is very important for gathering activities.

In order to reach a higher level in gathering, you need to earn gathering EXP through actual gathering activities. You can level up quicker if you use/consume an item that increases your gathering EXP, such as a scroll, an elixir, or a dish.


◈ Gathering Ability
Your gathering ability affects your gathering speed. You can reach up to Lv. 5 for gathering ability, and can check your current ability level from your character profile (hotkey: P).



One good way to increase your gathering ability is by eating a dish with that effect, such as a seafood cron meal. This method is efficient because it increases your gathering ability level and other stats for 2 hours at a relatively low price.

Wearing silver embroidered gatherer’s clothes can also help. Your gathering ability level increases along with the amount of gathering EXP you can obtain, depending on the enhancement level of the clothes. The effect is permanent, and equipping these clothes after enhancing them to +2 will make them quite efficient.

If after this your gathering ability level is still low, you can increase it through elixirs, like a verdure draught, or through guild skills provided by your guild.

If you really are thinking about seriously diving into gathering, it’s a good idea to have a method to consistently reach gathering ability Lv. 5 through these methods.However, it goes without saying that there is no point in consistently having gathering ability Lv. 5 if you’re taking a silver loss by doing so. It might be more profitable to spend silver on this once your gathering level is higher and allows you to more easily net a profit.


◈ Gathering Mastery
The higher your gathering mastery is, it plays an important role in gathering efficiency and thereby increases your profits.



You can check your gathering mastery level, as well as those for other life skills, at your character’s profile (hotkey: P).The results of gathering, or the gathering resources you obtain, can be divided into basic, special, and rare gathering resources. You can make a higher profit the more frequently you can obtain special and rare gathering resources.

As your gathering mastery level goes up, the amount of basic gathering resources obtained increases, along with the chance of obtaining special and rare gathering resources.



Remember that, the higher your mastery level, the higher the chance you have at obtaining a rare item from gathering, such as the Caphras stone seen above.

There are various ways to increase your mastery level. The most basic way is increasing your gathering level. Your gathering mastery level goes up every time your gathering level goes up.

Another way is by equipping, or consuming, items that increase your mastery level. There are many items, such as equipment (gear), elixirs, and dishes, that can be obtained for this; from those you can purchase or craft at a reasonable price, to those that you have to pay a large sum of silver for, depending on their effects. Regarding this, it is recommended to carefully make these purchases after coming up with a plan, keeping your financial status in mind.

It is said that “the higher the mastery level, the better,” but if you are an Adventurer just starting to get used to gathering, it’s more important to first experience it fully even if you have simpler equipment, than to go all-out in obtaining the best possible items for it from the start.

Check the following section to see more details on gathering equipment and useful items.



During your journey in the Land of the Morning Light across the Great Ocean, you may come across the Green Thumb questline started by NPC Hyunyong if your character is above artisan 1 in the gathering life skill.Upon completing this questline and obtaining the knowledge entry Green Thumb, you will obtain the gathering skill passed down to the gatherers who have won recognition from the Chorong Merchant Guild. Those who learn this skill become capable of recognizing the weakest parts of the gatherable resources, which allows them to gather large amounts of materials in one go.

This will allow you to be able to play a mini-game at a set probability while gathering.Winning the mini-game will consume 10 energy, and you will obtain 10 times the amount of items you'd originally gathered.For example, if you would have normally obtained Lamb Meat x10, Hard Black Crystal Shard x1, and Black Gem Fragment x2, upon successfully completing the mini-game you will obtain Lamb Meat x100, Hard Black Crystal Shard x10, and Black Gem Fragment x20.Failing the mini-game will consume 1 energy, and you will not receive any benefits.

◈ Hoe Gathering
Hoe all the roots and gather the herbs!– Use W, A, S, D to move the slots and Space to use the hoe.– Dig the same spot 3 times to fill back the hole with dirt.
After digging up all the roots, the areas without roots should be restored to their original state.




◈ Butchering
Win the mini-game 3 times by timing it right!– Press Space to stop the gauge where the meat icon is.




◈ Tanning
Cut the leather without going beyond the guidelines!– You can adjust the position of the falling icon by pressing Space.– You must reach the target point without crossing the guidelines.




◈ Mining
Target the weak parts of the rock to successfully mine it!– Use W, A, S, D to move the pickaxe and Space to use it.– If you find a weak part on the rock, you must keep hitting it until it cracks.




◈ Lumbering
Win the mini-game 5 consecutive times by timing it right!– Swing your axe in the specific area within the moving gauge!– Swing your axe without going outside the gradually shrinking area.




◈ Fluid Collecting
Fill up the fluid collector with liquid!– Hold Space to fill the gauge, and release Space when it aligns with a specific area.– Letting go in a blue area will fill the syringe with more liquid than in a green area.




◈ Millennial Wild Ginseng
Millennial wild ginseng is an incredible item that can be obtained at a low probability through the gathering mini-games.







In the sections above, you were able to see how you need proper gathering tools for gathering depending on the gathering resources. You also saw how you can increase the efficiency for gathering by increasing your gathering level, ability level, and mastery.Now it’s time to prepare equipment appropriate for gathering, and gather the resources that are spread all around Black Desert’s world. You will see that there are many different types of gathering equipment and items, for different purposes and performance requirements.

A way to start gathering right away with minimal equipment is to go to a Material Vendor NPC, found in each town, and purchase gathering tools that have the word “improved” in their names.This equipment is suitable for beginners, since you can equip them under any condition. Additionally, they offer a reduced gathering time.



Above you can see the different improved gathering tools offered by a Material Vendor NPC. If you are an Adventurer who wants to be more well-prepared for gathering, it is important to select the most suitable gathering equipment from the various options available, depending on your current situation and financial status.For example, if you are a beginner to gathering, you should mostly select equipment that increases overall Life EXP or gathering EXP in order to quickly increase your character’s gathering level.If you are already at a high level in gathering, you should increase your chance at obtaining rare gathering resources and their quantity by focusing on increasing your gathering mastery level.

Make sure to prepare yourself when you go on a gathering adventure by checking your gathering equipment and other life skills, and form an appropriate plan.

For Leight’s gathering tools, you can rent them in exchange for 50 contribution points from the owner of the Northern Wheat Plantation, Norma Leight, in Calpheon.

That said, be sure to check the requirement for equipping all of these items before trying to obtain them.

When you reach Lv. 49 with your character, the Black Spirit will have a new quest for you, called [Tool Bag] Liana's Invention.  After completing the 2 quests from Liana, this one will reward you with Liana’s Tool Bag, an item designed by her and her brother to conveniently store and take out tools with ease.

Once you’ve obtained this bag, which takes an inventory slot and is equipped to the gathering tool slot, a new button will appear in your inventory window: Tool Bag. Press it to open the tool bag window, where you can store and take out one of each type of gathering tool.
You must unequip Liana's Tool Bag and be in an idle stance to change the gathering tools in the bag.Even if you can put any permitted tool in the bag, you cannot equip a gathering tool stored in Liana's Tool Bag without meeting its life skill level requirements.

Liana's Tool Bag cannot hold temporary or character-bound tools, and one cannot use the Item Copy function on Liana's Tool Bag. Lastly, you cannot store items rented with contribution points in Liana's Tool Bag as well.

You can accept gathering-related quests from a variety of NPCs in the world of Black Desert.First, we recommend that you proceed with gathering quests you can find in Velia, the first town most Adventurers visit.

It requires some time and effort to complete gathering quests, but for rewards, you can obtain contribution EXP, gathering EXP, as well as rare items like sharp black crystal shards. We also recommend that you proceed with an advancement quest, called leap quests, to help you reach a higher gathering level. You can accept the leap quest once you reach the gathering level beginner Lv. 10.Once you’re at this gathering level, summon the Black Spirit and check its guide menu, where you can find the available leap quests for all life skills and you can be guided to the NPC you can receive the quests from more easily by simply pressing them from the list.


Subtópico: Lakiaro
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
Lakiaros are very rare medicinal plants that used to grow in the mountains of Drieghan. They were thought to have become extinct when a dark force contaminated the land there. However, when the Drieghanese buried the dragon’s fang and the blessed rain fell from the skies, the lakiaro also started to appear again.This "miracle of Drieghan" not only started appearing again, but its range expanded beyond the mountains, and even into Kamasylvia to the west. Still, they remain relatively rare, so if you are out looking for them, you might have to search in a wider area than you would first think.

To dig up lakiaros, you will have to play a gathering minigame. If you find a lakiaro, you can equip one of a few hoes (Manos Hoe, Dostter Hoe, or Dostter Steel Hoe) and interact with the lakiaro plant to start the minigame.The object of this minigame is to either find all of the roots of the lakiaro, or dig up all of the dirt around the plant. If you are too rough while digging for the lakiaro roots, you may damage them, reducing the total value of the rewarded lakiaro you receive.

Once the minigame has started, simply left or right-click to dig up around the lakiaro. You will get a better reward the less damaged the lakiaro ends up. Besides, if you manage to dig up a perfectly intact lakiaro root, you will be able to sell your reward for a high price.

So what are you waiting for, find a lakiaro plant and start digging!


◈ Minigame
There are seven types of lakiaro. When you find one while traveling around Drieghan and Kamasylvia, you can interact with it to start the minigame.



The minigame to dig up a lakiaro is tile-based. It can be either a 12x12 or 14x14 grid, depending on the type of lakiaro you are digging up. 14x14 grids are naturally harder to successfully complete, but tend to give better rewards.

The objective of the minigame is to dig up the lakiaro while damaging it as little as possible.Depending on the remaining value of the lakiaro after it is dug up, you will get different rewards. Both the value (starting at 100% and degrading every time you damage the plant) and the given rewards for your current value can be seen in the right side of the minigame window.

The difficulty of the minigame will depend on the type of lakiaro you are trying to dig up.Depending on the lakiaro you’ve encountered, the minigame can have a different number of stages or tiles, which will determine its total difficulty.

There are two ways to approach the lakiaro while digging for it.

Description
Digging up Pebbles
Dig Deeply (LMB)
Unlimited
You can dig up dirt and pebbles, but you will damage the lakiaro if you touch one of its roots.
Your hoe’s durability will decrease.
(If your hoe’s durability is 0, you can keep digging but the hoe will not be able to use its enhancement effects.)
Dig Shallowly (RMB)
Depends on your hoe’s enhancement level
You won’t damage the lakiaro roots, but you will not be able to dig up dirt or pebbles.



As seen above, a perfectly dug lakiaro will give you a reward based on 100% of its value.


Tips!

• You cannot be attacked while playing the lakiaro minigame.

• You cannot play the minigame if you have exceeded 150% of your weight limit.

• You can go to NPC Dostter in Duvencrune Farmland to do the lakiaro tutorial quests (Burning Thirst, Lakiaro for Research) to help you understand the minigame better.

• In the southern areas of Duvencrune Farmland you can practice digging up lakiaros as much as you want. However, these won’t give you a reward for completing the minigame.
◈ Hoes
Specific gathering tools are used to dig up lakiaro plants: Dostter Hoe, Dostter Steel Hoe, and Manos Hoe.Dostter Steel Hoe and Manos Hoe can be enhanced with Black Stone (Weapon) and Concentrated Magical Black Stone (Weapon) to PEN (V) level.

As one of these hoes are enhanced, they will: cause less damage to the lakiaro when digging deeply; be able to dig shallowly more times; have a greater maximum durability; dig up more area per each deep dig.

The Manos Hoe can be manufactured. The ingredients are as follows.

◈ Rewards
Depending on the remaining value of the lakiaro after it is dug up, you will get differently valued rewards in the form of lakiaro sacks.



From these sacks you will obtain a lakiaro plant as well as some other items, such as sharp & hard black crystal shards, Laila’s petals, traces, and even mythical feathers for the better rewards.

If you manage to dig up an intact primitive lakiaro, you will get a reward worth 100 million silver. The lush variants of each type will increase the rewarded plant’s value a bit, at a certain proportion.Lush high-quality lakiaro and lush primitive lakiaro are more difficult to dig up because of the greater number of tiles. However, this is compensated by the better rewards they give.

Subtópico: Fishing
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
Fishing has been considered a great leisure activity for people throughout the ages, and a means of survival for those living in rivers, the coastline, and islands.

Many artists have praised fishing and left poetry and pictures which celebrated fishing. Such taste can be enjoyed within the world of Black Desert as well.

Fishing is not just a way to catch sea food, but it is also an activity of recreation and relaxation.


◈ The Basics
You will need a fishing rod in order to enjoy fishing.You can buy your first fishing rods from wharf managers and fishers, or get them as part of doing beginner fishing quests.



Down the line you can purchase more advanced fishing rods, or craft them on your own.

While you can equip the fishing rod on the main weapon slot of your character, in the sub-weapon slot you can equip fishing floats. By using floats on fishing rods you improve the chance to get more of a specific type of fish, be it considered  a bigger or rarer fish.Like with fishing rods, these fishing tools can be obtained as quest rewards, crafted in town workshops, or purchased in the Central Market.

You can fish anywhere there’s water: swamps, small creeks, lakes, rivers, the coastline, or the open seas. You can also get on rowboats, fishing boats, and bigger boats to fish while at sea.However, you won’t be able to fish in water that is too shallow.



Equip a fishing rod and certain UI elements will show up in the upper part of the screen. These let you know the state of fishing resources in the area, and give you a couple options: to not be carried away by other Adventurers’ ships, and to select which grade of fish you do not want to obtain.

We recommend all Adventurers to have the first option toggled on.

Regarding the grade of fish to discard, it becomes available as you level up the fishing life skill. From professional 1 onward you will be able to discard green grade items. From artisan 1, blue grade items. From master 1, yellow grade items.

In a location where a lot of Adventurers are fishing, the fishing resources available get reduced. As this happens, the time it takes to fish will become longer.You can check the fishing resource status right away when you equip a fishing rod, you can also open the World Map screen (hotkey: M) and look through the Territory Resource Information tab.





When you have equipped a fishing rod, go near water and press the Space key to throw the fish hook away. After this, you just have to wait for the fish to bite. Depending on the fishing resources available, this will take more or less time.

After waiting for a bit, the fish will bite. Once this happens, press the Space key again and a minigame will begin.A moving gauge will show up, and you will have three chances to hit the Space key again to stop the gauge in the right position and succeed.After this, you will need to press the WASD key commands in the given order presented, in a limited time, to get the fish. The difficulty of the commands will depend on the category of the fish to possibly obtain, but does not guarantee its acquisition.



If you fish often, you will obtain fishing EXP, and with time your character’s fishing level will go up. As your fishing level goes up, the chances for fishing better graded fish will also go up.

The kind of fish you can get is different for each territory.
Fish obtained is regularly used as a cooking or alchemy material, but it can also be considered an expensive trade item depending on the rarity of the fish.
Most fish have a price guarantee timer on them. The more time passes, the less valuable the fish will be, and after the timer runs out, the fish will be considered expired and won’t be usable for any purpose. An expired fish can only be thrown away, or sold for no silver. If you want to preserve your obtained fish for use as a cooking ingredient, you can dry them via processing (hotkey: L). Via this method you can keep the dried product regardless of price guarantee, but it loses its status as a trade item.
If you still want to use the dried fish as a trade item, you can later turn it back into a trade item by packaging it into boxes at a town workshop.





After something has been hooked to the fishing rod, if you do not press the Space key to start the minigame, auto-fishing will begin. After a set amount of time, the auto-fishing period will end and you will receive the item without having to do the minigame. The auto-fishing time depends on the fishing rod you’re using and the different auto-fishing time reduction bonuses you can stack up by consuming dishes, elixirs, using pet skills, and more.

If you’re worried about filling your character’s inventory with low grade fish during auto-fishing, you can select the grade of fish you wish to keep, as detailed above.

​​​​​​​

◈ Fish Guide
The fish guide contains information about the fish you can get through fishing.
Only the fish you have gotten yourself is shown in the guide, and you can look at the knowledge entry, how many times you’ve caught that fish, the maximum size of the fish you’ve caught, and the leaderboard for the biggest fish of each type you’ve caught.
The guide will be updated whenever you catch a fish bigger than your previous record. However, if you log off as soon as you catch the fish, there’s a chance that your data might not be saved.The leaderboard will show the Adventurers’ name of those that caught the bigger fish, and for those that caught same sized fish, the Adventurer who caught that size first will be ranked higher.

​​​​​​​​​​​​​

You can access the fish guide by going into the main menu (hotkey: Esc) → Life → Fish Guide.

With the information given in this page you are now ready to experience the essence of fishing in Black Desert’s world on your own. However, if you want to know more about this life skill in detail, we recommend you check the [Advanced Fishing Guide] page.
*The content of the game guide may differ from the actual game content, depending on the update and content changes.

Subtópico: Advanced Fishing Guide
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
In this page we will be going over the more specific details regarding the fishing life skill. For the basics, please check the [Fishing] page.


There are three types of fishing: normal manual fishing, auto-fishing, and harpoon fishing.

Manual fishing is when you catch fish manually, one by one, by playing the minigame presented for each fishing cycle.

Auto-fishing is carried out automatically when you don’t take any action after a fish bites.Fish will be automatically collected after 180 seconds (3 minutes), after which the character will throw the hook away again, repeating the fishing process. Harpoon fishing consists of catching fish with a harpoon at sea.For this variety of fishing you will need to obtain a harpoon, which can be crafted at a town tool workshop, and a fishing boat, or a cog, to go out to sea.



Once this is done, equip the harpoon, point at water, and press the Space key. Once a deep sea fish is detected, a prompt will appear to begin the minigame.



The minigame for harpoon fishing is not the same one as for normal fishing. In this one, you need to find the fish’ shadow underwater and press the Space key on top of it, throwing harpoons at it to weaken the fish. Once weakened enough, it will be yours.You’re given a minute and 15 harpoons to catch the fish.



Please note that there is no auto-harpoon fishing.

The Balenos/Calpheon/Epheria/Mediah fishing rods and ash tree/maple floats can be enhanced with black stones, and the effects will be improved when their enhancement level increases.Additionally, for the Balenos fishing rod and Epheria fishing rod, the durability will go up when you enhance them with black stones, which means you can fish for a long time with them before needing to go repair them. But be careful, since the enhancement level can go down after failing an enhancement attempt after +7.If you want to avoid the risk of enhancement failure, use a lot of black stone and try force-enhancement. However, remember that you will need to repair the maximum durability of the rod and float afterwards.

On the other hand, a triple-float fishing rod is very efficient, since you can catch a lot of fish at once. But it is a one-time-use fishing rod that can’t be repaired or enhanced.

You can check additional information on rare fish and big fish in the in-game knowledge window (hotkey: H) by going to Life Skill → Fishing.



Overall, picking a fishing rod that suits you and your intended purpose best is part of the fun.




However, all open sea hotspots will have a distinctive feature. A flock of seagulls above them, catching fish. Whenever you see a circle of seagulls surrounding a small area, that means the area is a fishing hotspot.

Please note that sea hotspots, those with seagulls above them, are not permanent, but appear and disappear from time to time. In the same manner, as you fish in them, you might catch all the fish in them, making them disappear. But you do not have to worry, as after a certain amount of time has passed the hotspot will reappear.


The area next to Velia is a popular destination for Adventurers leaving their characters AFK to fish for extended periods of time.



You can sell your fish to a Trade Manager or Imperial Fishing Delivery Manager NPC.

Contrary to most forms of trade, you do not need to have the nodes connected from the point of origin to the location you want to sell your fish in.The point of origin will determine how much the fish will be valued when you sell it. The longer the distance between the point of origin and the point of sale, the greater the value. However, the longer you take to sell the fish, the less base value it will have. Make sure to strike a balance between the two in your favor.


If you caught your fish at sea, the origin point is divided by the water territory, but it actually displays the island that represents the nearest sea area to it, so the place you actually caught the fish and the displayed location can be slightly different.


As seen in the example above, fish sold near their area of origin as soon as possible will grant less extra profit (the green additional percentage), but will maintain all of its base value (the 100% below its price).



You can reduce the time it takes for fish to bite by increasing your character’s fishing speed ability level. You can check this one in your character’s profile (hotkey: P), on the ability section.



By improving this, you can get more fish during the same amount of time.If you’ve decided to go fishing, it is a good idea to get your character up to level 5 of this ability, as it will reduce the time taken for fish to bite by 50%.

You can raise this ability level through dishes, elixirs, certain clothes, and guild skills.The simplest way to increase it is by using a guild skill. Of course, the guild skill can be applied only when you are in a guild, so if you’re a fisher without a guild, don’t forget to ask what level of Art of Fishing the guild has reached before you join them.

Next, you can also increase it by wearing silver embroidered fisher’s clothes.When you enhance them to +2, it’ll grant you 2 fishing speed ability levels.This means that, by getting 3 from the guild skill, and getting 2 from the clothes, you can get to have the 5 levels easily whenever you fish.

If you’re not in a guild, or this one does not possess that skill, you can increase the remaining levels with dishes and elixirs.The Balenos meal will boost your fishing speed ability level by 2 for 90 minutes, so it is very useful.



The magnificence of a +5 silver embroidered fisher’s clothes!



Depending on the life skill, mastery may affect the quantity of items you can gather, or the amount you can process all at once. For fishing, mastery increases the chance of catching a prize catch, which includes both prize catch fish and ancient relic crystal shards.However, keep in mind that mastery will not increase your chance to catch fish categorized as rare.

Prize catch fishes are some of the rarest you can find while fishing, both inland and out at sea, and both with a fishing rod and with a harpoon.
While mastery will increase the chance at which we may find a prize catch with a fishing rod, it works a bit differently when fishing with a harpoon. For these, if your mastery is too low you may not even be able to find prize catch fishes. A minimum amount of mastery is required, and after that, certain thresholds need to be reached to increase your prize catch harpoon level, of which there are up to 3.

If you want to try your luck with prize catch fish, ask other experienced fishers first for the best locations and equipment!



During your travels throughout the continent you might have spotted certain NPCs in or near wharfs with the title <Imperial Fishing Delivery>.



These imperial delivery managers take valuable goods sought after by the imperial court, and due to this they always purchase them at 250% of their market price.

Additionally, the price distance bonus from selling fish also applies when selling it to an imperial fishing delivery manager!

There is a limit on the number of fish that can be delivered to a specific imperial fishing delivery manager. When the Imperial Delivery NPC has purchased the quantity of a fish they ask for, the number seen in the above picture will reach 0 and the NPC won’t purchase any more of it.

During imperial fishing delivery you compete with other Adventurers with the objective to sell the most fish to each imperial fishing delivery manager. Once the NPC you prepared to sell fish to has fulfilled their quota for that event cycle, you can change servers, try your luck elsewhere, or wait until the next cycle of the event.



Aside from silver profit, which is variable on the original market price of a fish and the distance you traveled to sell it, Imperial Fishing Delivery NPCs will give you golden seals when delivering fish to them, at a certain rate. These seals can then be exchanged for a myriad of items at a certain NPC.

The following items can be exchanged at NPC Abelin, in the town of Velia.

Finally, you can accept fishing-related quests from a variety of NPCs in the world of Black Desert.First, we recommend that you proceed with the quests you can find in Velia, the first town most Adventurers visit.

It requires some time and effort to complete these quests, but for rewards, you can obtain contribution EXP, fishing EXP, as well as rare items like sharp & hard black crystal shards. We also recommend that you proceed with advancement quests, called leap quests, to help you reach a higher fishing level. You can accept the leap quest once you reach the fishing level beginner Lv. 10.Once you’re at this fishing level, summon the Black Spirit and check its guide menu, where you can find the available leap quests for all life skills and you can be guided to the NPC you can receive the quests from more easily by simply pressing them from the list.



Additionally, after completing certain fishing leap quests you will unlock the Honor to the Fishing Family quests. These will reward you valuable and useful items for having completed a leap quest.


◈ Shim Cheong's Miraculous Fish Tank
Fish stored in this fish tank have their price guarantee duration increased by five times, giving you more time before you have to sell it.If you have this item in your bag, fish obtained through fishing will be automatically stored inside. The fish stored in the fish tank can be sold to trade managers and delivered for Imperial Fishing Delivery without the need to take it out of the fish tank.

However, the fish taken out of the fish tank have their price guarantee duration decreased by five times.


You can obtain Shim Cheong's Miraculous Fish Tank by giving 4 Iridescent Shellfish to Shim Cheong at the Sea Palace, off the coast of Land of the Morning Light. The 4 Iridescent Shellfish you need can be obtained via weekly quests from NPC Dorio in the Sea Palace.Remember that the exchange also requires you to have completed Shim Cheong’s tale first!

Subtópico: Hunting

Well, it’s not totally wrong. The announcement means that a blue whale or fugitive khalk appeared somewhere at sea or on the continent. They are large monsters, meaning you can’t hunt them single-handedly. You should hunt them down together with other Adventurers, and with matchlocks. It can feel daunting for a beginner.

However, this does not mean these hunting bosses are out of your league. While engaging them requires several Adventurers, a matchlock, and a land mount or ship, this is all it takes to participate. Stop worrying and just give it a try!

As you can see from the image above, you can see the status of the hunting life skill for your character in its profile (hotkey: P).If you’ve never hunted before, it will likely be at Beginner 1.

You will also likely not know what monsters can be hunted, or where they’re located.Hunting monsters display a different icon in the minimap, compared to normal monsters, and they can be found in many locations throughout the world.
The icon they’re displayed with resembles that of a deer. Whenever you see an enemy with this icon, know that attacking it with your usual weapons will do very little damage. They need to be attacked with a hunting matchlock.

The more you hunt, the more hunting life skill experience you’ll receive, and the higher your hunting life skill level will become.

As said above, normal weaponry will deal very little damage to these enemies. You require hunting matchlocks for the task. Hunting matchlocks are not sold in NPC shops; they must be rented from an NPC, crafted by yourself, or purchased from the Central Market.

They can be crafted at a house employed as a tool workshop, and depending on the level of the workshop you will be able to craft a matchlock that matches your hunting life skill level.

Alternatively, if it's too cumbersome to do this, you can buy a matchlock appropriate to your hunting life skill level at the Central Market, if there are any on sale.You can find them in the Life Tools → Matchlock category.

– How to Operate a Matchlock
After equipping it, you can reload a matchlock by right clicking your mouse. You can fire it by left clicking.You can crouch by pressing the Q key, and while crouched the shooting range and reloading speed of the matchlock increases.You can evade enemy attacks by rolling away by pressing any of the ASD keys + Shift key together. Pressing W+Shift while crouched lets you stand up and run.Certain matchlocks allow you to unleash a powerful attack with the F key once your character’s black spirit rage has reached 100%.For those hunting targets that are constantly on the move, you can also use a matchlock while riding a mount.

Like with other weaponry, a matchlock can be enhanced. However, you need to be careful because the enhancement level will drop if you fail after the enhancement level reaches +7.
It will depend on the target to hunt, but in any case, a mount is essential for the more important foes.For example, blue whales are hunted in the open sea, so you’ll have to be on board a ship when hunting them. Since a ship can have several people on board, if an Adventurer takes the role of maneuvering the ship the rest can hunt right away without any major restriction.Fugitive khalks appear in a few locations throughout the continent, constantly flying around.Because of that, you have to hunt by following them on horseback.

When dealing with big hunting monsters with high attack power, such as khalks, giant lionesses, and elephants, if you ride a horse and go on horseback hunting, you can move easily enough to evade their attacks while reloading the matchlock. It can make hunting a little easier.
This is the most important thing to remember.Even if you have prepared all the above, it serves no purpose without a butcher knife.

After defeating a hunting monster, you must use a butcher knife to gather from it.Once you have gathered from their corpse with a butcher knife, you’ll get hunting life skill experience.

There are different types of butcher knives that can be employed, depending on your gathering level. All will work for this. The main difference is the speed at which you’ll gather with them, and their durability (number of times you can gather with them).

When hunting, just as there are dishes and elixirs that are helpful against normal monsters, there are dishes and elixirs that are helpful against hunting targets.It is not essential to use them, but if you prepare them, you will be able to increase your efficiency when hunting.

Beginners who are just starting hunting do not have to overdo it.After experiencing hunting to some extent, it is recommended to make your own dishes and elixirs using the cooking ingredients and alchemy materials you have obtained yourself, or purchase them through the Central Market.
Users who have experienced hunting to some extent will agree that the time it takes to reload a matchlock feels very long.While reloading the matchlock, you are defenseless from monster attacks, and the longer the reload time, the longer it takes to hunt.

If these feel very frustrating, eat a hunter's salad before setting out on a hunt.Hunter's salad and fresh hunter's salad increase the reload speed of the matchlock, so hunting after eating this dish will make the experience more enjoyable.
Like the hunter's salad, khalk's fermented wine is also very helpful for hunting.It can be said that it is more helpful than the hunter's salad because it not only increases the reload speed of the matchlock, but also increases your attack power and movement speed.You can buy it from the Central Market, but it's also good to make it yourself through cooking once you’ve hunted a fugitive khalk and obtained its horns.

Elixirs that raise critical hits are also helpful for hunting.If you use an elixir that increases the critical hit ability level, or critical hit rate, and proceed with hunting, you will be able to defeat hunting monsters with a lot of health a little faster.

In addition to this, all dishes, elixirs, draughts, perfumes, and scrolls that have a life experience gain increase option allow you to quickly raise your hunting level and equip a more powerful matchlock, so if you can afford it, it is recommended that you prepare as much as possible before setting out on a hunt.

In order to hunt blue whales and fugitive khalks, which will be explained later, powerful matchlocks are required, and certain hunting levels must be met to equip these matchlocks.The fastest way for beginners to level up hunting is to go through hunting quests.

Open the Quest window (hotkey: O), and check the Suggested tab. There, you will find a series of hunting quests that beginners can progress through to quickly level up. Do keep in mind that at a certain point you’ll be asked to travel to much more dangerous territories. When this happens, you may want to carry out other hunting quests detailed below.
On that tab you will also find the Hunting leap quests, available every once in a while as you progress through your hunting life skill levels.

In the Recurring tab you will find a list of daily quests that lead you to hunt several animals in Balenos and the islands beyond it.

We recommend you start with the quest [Daily] Easy Game given by Chuck Laurie near the town of Olvia. After completing his first few quests, you’ll unlock a hunting questline from Chief Igor Bartali, in Velia.Once that questline is completed, many hunting quests all over the islands of Balenos will be unlocked.

Most of those quests are done on the islands north of Balenos.Due to the nature of the quests that require you to cross the sea, it is a good idea to bring a sea mount such as a fishing boat or a sailboat.When you complete these quests, you can receive various rewards including titles and matchlocks. Among the monsters to hunt in the Balenos islands, the difficulty level is low, except for the king brown bear and the boss wolf.The brown bear does a knockback attack, and the boss wolf and giant wolf summon wolf cubs to assist them.
Below is a list of the islands of Balenos where node manager NPCs have the repair functionality.

– Rubiano Island– Anjou Island– Marka Island– Invernen Island– Orfs Island– Baremi Island
If you have raised your hunting life skill level through the quests above, and equipped a powerful matchlock, you can now go to defeat blue whales and fugitive khalks.However, if you want to have more experience before tackling cooperative hunting, it's good to practice with other hunting targets you can defeat alone.

Now is the time to search for monsters to hunt in other territories.Below will be introduced the different locations you can find hunting targets, and their rewards.

Many of the hunting quests everywhere will reward you with hunter’s tokens. These can be exchanged with Igor Bartali in Velia for rewards.

◈ The Balenos Mountains
The easiest and most comfortable hunting method for beginners is to catch deers, wild boars, and bears located in the Balenos Mountains.It's a location close to Olvia and Velia, and it's an easy distance to travel on horseback or on foot, so it's a good place for Adventurers who are new to hunting to gain experience.
There are a total of 3 types of land hunting monsters that appear in the Balenos Mountains.Giant elks, giant boars, and giant brown bears each have the <Wild> title above their names, so it is easy to distinguish them from normal monsters.

The deers are an ideal game for Adventurers who are just starting out hunting to test the performance of their matchlock. If you approach them, they will run away, so you can practice shooting at them while maintaining a certain distance.

When dealing with the boars and bears, please keep in mind that they’ll attack an Adventurer who approaches close first. Although their attack power is not very high, they’re a bit more complex as you need to keep moving to aim at them.

When you arrive at Lake Kaia, don't equip the matchlock right away. That is because the moment you equip it, your movement speed slows down and you can take damage from the nearby catfishmen.Whether you're defeating or avoiding the local monsters, as you wander around, you'll likely see freshwater crocodiles swimming around. If you find them, look closely at their movement path, find a good spot, equip the matchlock, and hunt them.

Catfishman monsters are around the levels 49-50, so if you are a Lv. 55 or higher character, you will be able to hunt the freshwater crocodiles without being disturbed by them.

After hunting one, you can climb on top of the freshwater crocodile carcass and gather from it with your butcher knife to get hunting experience and meat. For reference, there are 3 freshwater crocodiles in North Kaia Lake and 4 in South Kaia Lake, and their respawn time is very long compared to other hunting monsters, so it is recommended to hunt them while jumping between servers.

There’s no shortage of them, but it is difficult to find one easily due to how big the sea is.These monsters will not attack any mounts or characters, so you can hunt them with ease.Like freshwater crocodiles, these whales float on the water when defeated. Climb on top of them and gather from their carcass to obtain hunting experience and rewards.

You can obtain sharp black crystal shards, hard black crystal shards, black gems that can enhance life skill mastery equipment, and more.You can get various rewards from them, so if you want to go hunting for a while without leaving the sea, make sure to search for the humpback whales.



Talk to Zaaira, the Material Vendor NPC in Velia, and purchase the necessary item to craft the trap the quest describes.Additionally, even if you don't accept these quests, you can lure these two hunting boss monsters with this trap.

The stuffed head trophies from these boss monsters give a powerful buff effect, so even if you don't go through the quest, try summoning and hunting them with the trap.

If you make the trap to lure the white wolf boss, go to the Agris Steppe, and if you make the trap to lure the king brown bear boss, go to Fleme Hills to use them.

You can find several daily quests that ask you to hunt monsters in Kamasylvia. They require you to have reached the hunting life skill professional level.

The following is a list of quests for this area of the world.

The following hunting targets can be found in the Western Valtarra Mountains area: belladonna elephants, feather wolves, black leopards, gazelles, and ferries.

Please note that hunting gazelles goes against the Animal Protection Act treaty between the Republic of Calpheon and Kamasylvia, and thus hunting them will lower your karma for doing an outlawed action.

The king griffon is classified as a boss hunting monster, so you can check whether it is around in the UI icon that informs you of the appearance of hunting boss monsters.

Please note that king griffon moves in a clockwise direction along the following route inside Ash Forest. You can easily identify its location thanks to the yellow griffon icon visible in the World Map screen (hotkey: M).



The behavior pattern of the king griffon can be divided into two stages.In the first stage, it repeats a flight and attack pattern while flying, and in the second stage, it descends to the ground and attacks.

As any hunter who has hunted fugitive khalks has already noticed, when hunting the king griffon, you have to go horseback hunting.

If you have a horse with the Sideways skill, you do not have to worry about being on horseback for the entire battle. However, if you do not have that mount skill, please keep in mind that the horse may be killed by one of the king griffon’s attacks, so it is recommended to dismount after the first stage of the encounter has concluded.

If you hunt a king griffon and then butcher it, you can get an intact griffon beak, which is used as a material for making a piece of boss armor, the griffon's helmet.

For example, to the east in the Khimut Kumber Camp area you will find Drieghanese male and female goats you can hunt.
While all the llamas are timid and will run away when attacking one of them, the yaks are aggressive and will charge towards you, so make sure to remember to dodge in time!

As with other hunting targets, you may obtain their stuffed head trophies when butchering them.In the llamas’ case, you may obtain a whole stuffed body trophy!

After traveling around and encountering all kinds of hunting targets, it's time to try cooperative hunting.

Look at the bottom right of the screen. If you see a matchlock-shaped icon, you will sometimes see a (+) icon attached to it. This icon means that hunting boss monsters, such as blue whales, fugitive khalks, king griffons, and others, have appeared in that channel.
Above you can see the system notifications when a blue whale (top) and fugitive khalk (bottom) appear in a server.

While it can be said that the main purpose for hunting blue whales and fugitive khalks is the fun to be had, the ingredient materials obtained from butchering their corpses offer a nice incentive.You can craft blue grade accessories with some of the materials you obtain, and with others you can prepare useful dishes and alchemical elixirs.

In the case of blue whales, they appear at regular intervals three times a day for each channel.

There is nothing to be very careful about while hunting.Since the blue whale is subtly fast, one of the party members can directly drive a fast boat (such as a fishing boat or sailboat) to constantly pursue the hunting boss, while the rest of the party members do their best to shoot at it.Due to the vast amount of health the blue whales possess, the top 20 participating parties in the encounter will be rewarded with butchering rights.
The picture above shows the routes of the blue whales that can appear in the Calpheon (red line), Balenos (yellow line), and Mediah (blue line) seas. Make sure to follow those lines if your group is searching for a blue whale.

If you’re a first time hunter Adventurer, keep an eye on the server-wide chat channels in case you see people speak about these bosses. Occasionally, you can see others asking if blue whales have appeared, but most of the Adventurers that delve in this aspect of the game are professional whale hunters.
If you make friends with them and catch whales in a party, you can easily adapt and mingle.

Looting rights are limited to the top 20 parties that have participated in hunting the blue whales, and the party that enters the ranking is given a chance to butcher the boss once per party member.

Fugitive khalks appear in the Longleaf Tree Forest area in southwestern Calpheon, and near Tungrad Forest and Hasrah Cliff in Mediah.Because they fly in a set path, you must ride a horse and follow it while hunting.

In the case of the fugitive khalks, unlike the blue whales, they appear twice a day on each server at regular intervals.

In order to hunt on horseback, you must equip a matchlock while mounted.
In the pictures below you can see the routes the fugitive khalks travel.Unlike blue whales, they are relatively easy to find because the route is short and there are no major restrictions on movement.However, if there is one thing to be cautious about, it is that you must ride your horse well. That is because you have to be paying attention to two things at once: Whether you're looking at the sky, or maneuvering the horse. It's something you get used to once you've done it a few times.

The rules for acquiring looting rights are the same as for blue whales, only the top 20 parties can butcher the defeated fugitive khalk.

You can use a mirror of equilibrium to extract the [Hunting] Gauche Master Matchlock to obtain [Hunting] Master Matchlock x1 and Steel x1.

Sniper rifles can be used to hunt monsters from a great distance and target their weak spots.You will receive different results depending on the equipment power, hunting mastery, and your skill in playing the minigame to load and aim the sniper rifle.

You can use sniper rifles just like existing hunting matchlocks by pressing RMB while crouched.Your character must be at least Lv. 30 to be able to use these rifles.
The [Hunting] Practice Sniper Rifle does not require a hunting level to equip, but the [Hunting] Sniper Rifle requires you to be apprentice 10 in the hunting life skill, or have at least 50 hunting mastery.In the Land of the Morning Light (LoML) across the Great Ocean, you can craft a better sniper rifle, the [Hunting] Marni Sniper Rifle, at the "Dokkebi Tool Workshop" in the Dokkebi Jar. To use it, you need to be artisan 10 or above.

The [Hunting] Practice Sniper Rifle cannot be enhanced, while the [Hunting] Sniper Rifle can be enhanced using Black Stones (Weapon). The [Hunting] Marni Sniper Rifle can be enhanced with Scorching Sun Gemstone.

The practice sniper rifle can be obtained as a reward for the quest A Struggle with the Seagull given by Chuck Laurie, the sniper rifle can be crafted through manufacture (hotkey: L), and the Marni sniper rifle can be crafted in the above-mentioned workshop in the Dokkebi Jar.

When on standby while equipped with this sniper rifle, right-clicking will smoothly transition into the seated aiming position.

Equipping the Marni sniper rifle will change the appearance of the gun in the sniper UI.
◈ Wild Game Preserve
While you can practice your sniping skills with the elks found in the Fleme Hills, in Balenos, the wild game preserve in the Land of the Morning Light is where sniping truly shines.You will primarily be able to hunt boars, bears, and hawks in the wild game preserve.According to the Dalbeol villagers passing by, you'll sometimes come across boars and bears that are different from the usual, and tigers as well. You can obtain rarer items at a higher probability by defeating such animals.When a gunshot resounds throughout a sniper hunting zone, animals within a 100m radius will react to the sound.Keep in mind that boars, bears, and tigers will charge toward you when fired at with a rifle, and thus can be quite dangerous.
◈ Thunderpaw
The number of people who claim to have seen a gigantic pawprint in Beombawi Valley, in the Land of the Morning Light, is growing. Imagining the immense size of the owner of this paw, the people have started calling it "Thunderpaw". Though a couple of curious hunters set off to hunt this Thunderpaw, only a sporadic volley of gunshots was heard and none returned home.

To encounter <Mountain Shaking> Thunderpaw, install Honey-coated Meat in their respective locations. Honey-coated Meat can be crafted from Sticky Honey x10 + Pork x300 via simple cooking (hotkey: L). Sticky honey can be obtained by completing daily quests given by Huntkkebi in the wild game preserve.

– Thunderpaw can be taken down through sniper hunting.– Thunderpaw deals critical damage, so it is best to conceal yourself while attacking.– When Thunderpaw is hit, it rears up on its hind legs and looks around. This is a chance for you to evade its attention by hiding your body behind obstacles such as trees or rocks.– If you are too close when you attack Thunderpaw, concealing your body may not be enough to evade its attack.– Thunderpaw has a strong affinity for honey, so bees become wary of its presence and show defensive behavior.– When Thunderpaw charges toward you, you can lure it toward nearby beehives, allowing the bees to attack it and buy you some time to escape.

Please note that death penalties (EXP decrease, crystal destruction, etc.) are not applied when you die to <Mountain Shaking> Thunderpaw, and that if you stray too far while in combat with <Mountain Shaking> Thunderpaw, it will go back to its original location. In this case, the HP of <Mountain Shaking> Thunderpaw will recover to 100%, and the beehives will reappear.




The higher your hunting life skill mastery, the more items you will obtain from butchering defeated hunting targets, and the higher the chance to gain rare resources from them. This excludes the items obtained from butchering blue whales, fugitive khalks, humpback whales, and freshwater crocodiles.

Please also note that using a magic or lucky butcher knife on hunted monsters does not further increase your chances.

Your hunting mastery also lets you use certain matchlocks regardless of your hunting life skill level. For example, if you have a professional 2 level of hunting but 400 hunting life skill mastery, you can use a [hunting] artisan matchlock even if you haven’t reached the professional 10 hunting life skill level.

As you increase your hunting life skill mastery, you’ll start obtaining several types of hides. These can be used together with stuffed hunting trophies to craft higher grade versions of the same items. These grant a better buff, or extend its duration.

Additionally, once you possess 250 or more hunting life skill mastery, you’ll be able to obtain the wildspark byproduct item when butchering hunting monsters. Collect x10 wildsparks and visit NPC Liana in each major city to exchange them for the following items:

Required Item
Exchangeable Item (Select one)
Wildspark x10
Spirit Pouch of Ferocious Beast x1
Black Gem Fragment x5
900 Contribution EXP + Hunting EXP x30


Subtópico: Cooking
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
Cooking is one of the easiest life skill features of Black Desert that everyone can enjoy with just a little bit of preparation. The output of cooking is dishes that can be consumed to gain all kinds of buffs useful for all types of content one can find throughout the world. This food can also be sold to both other Adventurers and NPCs, in this way serving as a stable source of income.

Even if you purchase the food you need from the Central Market, or even find that to be bothersome, all you have to do is just follow this guide to enjoy a bountiful life as an excellent cook. Let’s take an in-depth look at what you have to do to succeed as a cook in Black Desert’s world.





Additionally, cook’s clothes that can reduce your cooking time are one of the best first investments you can make when you delve into the world of cooking.


◈ Cooking Utensil
The first thing you need for cooking is your own residence. This is because the cooking utensils that are needed can only be installed in a residence.It is more convenient to have your residence near the storage where the ingredients for cooking are piled up. You can also have multiple residences, so it is recommended to have a cheap residence (one that costs only 1 contribution point) that is close to the town’s storage.

There are several types of cooking utensils. The simpler and less durable ones can be purchased at NPC shops, such as an innkeeper or food vendor. The more durable ones, such as intermediate or advanced cooking utensils, need to be crafted at a town workshop.

➤ You can read more about this activity to produce cooking utensils in the [Crafting] page.

Until you participate in imperial crafting delivery and can obtain supreme cooking utensils, we recommend obtaining & installing an advanced cooking utensil with which you can cook a minimum of 900 times and reduces cooking time by 1 second.The cooking utensil you can purchase at NPC shops is inconvenient in many ways, having no special effect and only being able to be used for around 100 times, and is not proper for cooking for a long time. It will, however, help you when you need to cook small quantities and you’re in a hurry.

You can craft advanced cooking utensils in level 3 tool workshops by yourself, or purchase them at the Central Market. If you find it hard to get an advanced cooking utensil, then you can use an intermediate cooking utensil (durability 500) instead.Other types of cooking utensils, such as regional traditional variations, exist, and they last longer than an intermediate cooking utensil, and even an advanced one, but they come with the special effect of cooking time taking longer.

The following is a list of some of the first tool workshops you will find as you travel the world.

Crafting materials for an advanced cooking utensil: x20 polished stones, x5 usable scantlings, x20 melted iron shards, x14 black stone powder.

Crafting Materials for an intermediate cooking utensil: x25 rough stones, x10 logs, x15 melted iron shards, x7 black stone powder.



Alternatively, if you’re currently in the Land of the Morning Light, or began your adventure there, you might be interested in crafting a Morning Light Traditional Cooking Utensil, which offers -1 cooking time like the advanced cooking utensil, and has a lot more durability. These can be crafted in the houses Morning Light Nampo 2 and Morning Light Nopsae 4, and require the following materials: x80 polished stone, x20 standardized timber square, x20 iron ingot, and x40 fire horn.


◈ Cooking Ingredients
There are basically two types of cooking ingredients: Seasonings such as sugar and salt you can get from any cooking vendor, and ingredients such as apples and pork that you can gather, process, and cultivate yourself. A great variety of cooking ingredients can be collected by workers you send to nodes to work.The difficulty of cooking can be defined by how the ingredients you need are supplied, so a stable supply of ingredients is really important. Node production, sending workers out into the world to collect materials for you, is directly related to managing contribution points, so you need to put some thought into this.



You can find where to get the ingredients you require by checking the crafting notes, accessible from the Adventurer’s Board (hotkey: F1 or F2).




◈ Cook’s Clothes
Silver embroidered cook's clothes have enough options to satisfy and greatly help everyone trying to delve into cooking. The base form of this equipment piece improves your character’s movement speed, and reduces its cooking time by 1 second. As the piece is enhanced, its effects increase and expand to include bonus cooking experience while cooking.

You can craft these clothes at any costume mill  town workshop with x9 cotton fabrics, x10 powder of earth, and x15 black stone powder.

At its maximum enhancement level, they provide +4 movement speed, +40% cooking experience, and a cooking time reduction of 7 seconds.



Once you have all the above set up, you need to bring the ingredients to your residence where your cooking utensils are installed. You can place cooking utensils in it with the Place Mode function that pops up when you enter your residence.

When you move to the front of the cooking utensils after placing them, you will see the interaction menu. You can activate the Start Cooking interface by pressing the R key or by clicking the Controls button with the mouse.On the right side of this window you can see all the dishes you can make in Black Desert. Dishes you haven’t cooked yet will be ambiguously displayed as “sauce for meat” or “sour seasoning” since you do not know exactly what the dishes are. On the other hand, if you have already cooked the dish, even just once, and therefore acquired knowledge about it, it will be marked with the dish’s exact name. Clicking on any dish you’ve already prepared in the past will let you check what recipe you used to cook the dish.



When the cooking window is displayed your character’s inventory will open as well. You can right-click the ingredients from there to add them to the cooking window. Do not worry about losing your ingredients, as until you press the Start Cooking button no item will be lost.

Cooking a dish usually requires a combination of 1 ~ 3 ingredients and 1 ~ 3 seasonings. Some dishes require finished dishes as ingredients. When you press the Start Cooking button after putting all the ingredients in, it will start the cooking process.

You can also select how many times you want to repeat cooking with the remaining ingredients you have in the inventory by putting in the ingredients required for one-time cooking and clicking the Batch Production button. The default is set to be ingredients required for cooking a dish only once, so you need to press the F key when you see the number window, or click the Maximum Quantity button.One thing you need to remember in batch production is that you have to put the ingredients required just for cooking once. Even if you put all the ingredients into the cooking slots and press the Batch Production button, it will only make one dish out of them.



Put in the ingredients for one dish and press the Start Cooking button to start making dishes!



If wheat is required for a dish, does it mean we can only put wheat and nothing else instead? The answer is no! That is because we can substitute certain ingredients. We can replace wheat with another grain, and that is the substitute. The category of grain includes not only wheat, but also barley, potato, sweet potato, and corn. Therefore, you can use another grain for the dish that requires grain and still have the same result.

However, it doesn’t mean that you can use a substitute unconditionally. Some dishes require more substitutes than the original ingredient when replacing the latter with the former. If you failed the cooking process after using a substitute, you might need more of it.

Please note that for certain dishes, such as gukbap, you cannot employ substitutes, only the intended ingredient.



You will never fail in cooking if you prepare the ingredients as specified in the recipe, even if you put more than required. If you succeed in cooking for the first time, you acquire the dish’s knowledge entry, which will detail the ingredients required for it.



Once you get a dish’s knowledge, go to the Knowledge interface (hotkey: H) and you’ll find it recorded there.



However, keep in mind that a specific cooking level is required for preparing certain dishes. That means you will fail in cooking, even if you have the right recipe and ingredients, if your cooking level is too low.

There are two main other reasons why you can fail cooking: You’ve got the wrong ingredients, or not enough of them. The probability of failure for the former case is 100%, but you might occasionally succeed in the latter case. If you sometimes succeed and sometimes don’t with the same ingredients, it is because you’re not using the correct ratio of ingredients.

If you have completed cooking successfully, you might get an interesting extra along with the food: witch’s delicacy. You can exchange it with an NPC for cooking & contribution experience, milk, or beer. Milk is a precious ingredient that can only be obtained manually from cows, and beer is the traditional item used to keep your workers motivated. However, it would be inconvenient to exchange these items you obtain from cooking bit by bit, so it is recommended that you keep them in your storage and exchange them later all at once.







So far, we have looked into the basics of cooking and its results. Now, let’s take a look at some helpful tips. First, let’s see how to level up the life skill faster.

1. Vinegar

Required Level
Cooking level beginner 1 or higher
Ingredient
[Golden Ratio] 1 Grain, 1 Fruit, 1 Leavening Agent, 1 Sugar

You can use wheat, barley, potato, sweet potato, and corn as the grain. Intensively produce one of them with node production, or purchase it in the Central Market. You can purchase leavening agent and sugar from food vendors in each territory.Vinegar is often required as an ingredient for other dishes, so instead of disposing of it, make sure to save it for later.

2. Beer

Required Level
Cooking level beginner 1 or higher (cool draft beer can be obtained at skilled 1 and higher levels)
Ingredient
[Golden Ratio] 5 Grain, 6 Mineral Water, 2 Leavening Agent, 1 Sugar

For grain, you can use wheat, barley, potato, sweet potato, and corn, same as in vinegar. You can purchase other ingredients from a food vendor.

In regard to the grain produced by garden farming, high-quality grain can be exchanged for 2, and special grain for 1. This means that instead of 5 wheat, you can use 2 high-quality wheat, or 1 special wheat.

Beer restores the stamina of your workers, so remember to always have them in stock.

3. Essence of Liquor

Required Level
Cooking level beginner 1 or higher
Ingredient
[Golden Ratio] 1 Flour, 1 Fruit, 1 Leavening Agent

For flour, you need to process (hotkey: L) any grain via the grinding method.As seen previously, for fruit you can choose any of the available ones. We recommend grapes and strawberries, as they can be obtained via node production.Last, as you know very well by now, leavening agent can be purchased at any food vendor NPC.

Essence of liquor is used when preparing other dishes such as citron cider, coconut cocktail, or fruit wine, which in turn are needed for further elaborate meals.



Since cooking buffs are essential for all aspects of the game, you can earn money by selling your dishes. You need to know the latest trend in cooking and be quick to make a profit.

Beer is definitely one of the most popular in the Central Market, but it is not good for making a lot of money because of its low price. Regional meals, such as Balenos meal, are always in high demand as well.

You need to make sure you study what your objective is and the efficiency of the method you’re going to use to reach it. You can sell beer for profit, but would perhaps using the beer to prepare more complex dishes be more profitable? Investigate on your own and ask other Adventurers to find out what better fits your options and playstyle.

Additionally, not only you can sell dishes to other Adventurers via the Central Market, but you can also deliver packaged dishes to the imperial court via the Imperial Crafting Delivery NPCs, so you will need to figure out what is more profitable with each dish, be it selling it to other Adventurers, using it for more elaborate dishes to then sell as well, package and deliver them to the imperial court, or any mix of the different options.

Reminder! Must-Have Items for Efficient Cooking!

​​​​​​​Silver Embroidered Cook's ClothesThe effect that these clothes initially give you might not seem so appealing to you. However, their real worth is proven after enhancing them. The ability boost from enhanced silver embroidered cook's clothes is detailed below.
+1: Movement Speed Level +1 & Cooking Time: -2 sec & Cooking Skill EXP +10%+2: Movement Speed Level +2 & Cooking Time: -3 sec & Cooking Skill EXP +15%+3: Movement Speed Level +2 & Cooking Time: -4 sec & Cooking Skill EXP +20%+4: Movement Speed Level +3 & Cooking Time: -5 sec & Cooking Skill EXP +25%+5: Movement Speed Level +4 & Cooking Time: -7 sec & Cooking Skill EXP +40% Advanced & Supreme Cooking UtensilThe durability of this utensil is 900, which is much higher than a regular one. Cooking time also decreases by 1 second when cooking with it, so it makes cooking much faster.

Once you’ve practiced cooking enough, you will be able to turn in cooking boxes to the Imperial Crafting Delivery NPCs. They will reward you with silver and golden seals. 500 of these golden seals can be then exchanged for a supreme cooking utensil.Like with advanced utensils, the supreme ones reduce the time spent cooking by 1 second, but possess 5,000 durability. They’re a cook’s best friend in the long run.

Alchemy Stone of Life / Life Spirit StoneThe worst alchemy stone of life you can obtain will decrease the time spent cooking by half a second. It may not sound as much, but stacked over thousands of prepared dishes, any reduction of cooking time ends up being appreciated. Additionally, this half a second stacks with all previous cooking time reductions.

You can craft these alchemy stones via alchemy, or purchase them from the Central Market. Life spirit stones can be obtained from certain monsters, as well.

Dishes & DraughtsCertain dishes, such as the seafood cron meal, will reduce cooking time. The same can be said for certain draughts like the verdure draught. However, keep in mind that these options are more expensive, and thus you have to calculate if using them will turn up a profit.



Cooking mastery increases the maximum number of dishes prepared while cooking.It also affects the number of extra dishes you can receive from the process, the chance of obtaining higher quality dishes, as well as the profit from turning in cooking boxes at the Imperial Crafting Delivery NPCs.

More importantly, cooking mastery increases your chance of activating mass cooking, which uses 10 times the ingredients to cook 10 portions of food all at once. This can reduce the time you spend cooking significantly, as the proc for this to happen does not negate either the one for the maximum number of dishes, nor the one for the number of extra dishes.

If you only want an increase in profit when turning in boxes of packed dishes, we recommend you swap your equipment for the pieces that increase cooking mastery only for the time you spend turning in the boxes.



One can accept cooking-related quests from a variety of NPCs in the world of Black Desert.First, we recommend that you proceed with the cooking quests you can find in Balenos, the first territory most Adventurers explore. In particular, in the town of Velia. We also recommend that you proceed with advancement quests, called leap quests, to help you reach a higher cooking level quicker.
It requires some time and effort to complete these quests, but for rewards, you can obtain contribution EXP, cooking EXP, as well as rare items like hard & sharp black crystal shards. You can accept the first leap quest once you reach the cooking level beginner 10.Once you’re at this cooking level, summon the Black Spirit and check its guide menu, where you can find the available leap quests for all life skills. You can be guided to the NPC you can receive the quests from more easily by simply pressing them from the list.​​​​​​​

Subtópico: Alchemy

Alchemy is considered magical in Black Desert’s world, and its impact in the world has had many far-reaching consequences. However, it’s a little bit different from the fantastical alchemy we’ve known throughout our own history. Instead of trying to turn lead into gold, it aims to refine and enhance the ingredients employed in order to obtain products with purer properties.


➤ For more information regarding residences, please check the [Houses] page.

Once you have a residence, know that there are several types of alchemy tools, but a basic one will suffice if you are just starting out. You can purchase it from most town General Goods Vendor NPC.



Once you’ve installed the alchemy tool in your residence, interact with it by pressing the R key, and the alchemy window will appear.


​​​​​​​
The beauty of alchemy is to figure out what ingredients are needed, and mixing them just right to find the perfect ratio.

Select the items from your inventory by right clicking them, and press the Create button to start the process. Depending on the type of tool and other bonuses you might possess, the time to carry out the action will take more or less time.

Keep in mind that, even if the recipe you’re using is correct, there’s a chance that you might fail alchemy if you don’t have the exact number of ingredients required. If you use two of an ingredient when you need three, you’ll have a much lower chance of success.

The ingredients that are used for alchemy greatly vary. They can be mainly obtained from defeating monsters, and gathering plants, animals and minerals.

You can perform alchemy numerous times by using the batch production function. After introducing into the cauldron the ingredients for a single process, press the Batch production button. This way, you’ll be able to perform alchemy until you run out of ingredients in your inventory, or reach your character’s max weight limit capacity



Ingredients made through alchemy are usually some of the best ingredients. Additionally, many magic crystals and a variety of elixirs can be earned only through alchemy.

If you succeed in synthesizing a product, you’ll earn alchemy EXP. Even if you fail, you will still earn a small amount of EXP. This way, through trial and error one will gradually level up the life skill. That said, make sure to not go overboard with experimenting, as ingredients for alchemy tend to be rather rare and expensive!

The higher your alchemy life skill level, the more diversity of elixirs, magic crystals, alchemy stones, and more that you will be able to create.

With the information given in this page you are now ready to delve into the world of alchemy. However, if you want to know more about this life skill in detail, we recommend you check the [Advanced Alchemy Guide] page.

In this page we will be going over the more specific details regarding the alchemy life skill. For the basics, please check the [Alchemy] page.

Alchemy is considered by many to be the final step of life skill content. There is nothing easy about alchemy, from gathering its ingredients and keeping a stable supply of them, to figuring out the recipes. This is why many Adventurers find it hard to start dabbling in it.

As your characters’ level goes up, you will be in desperate need of elixirs, magic crystals, alchemy stones, and processing materials that are obtained through alchemy alone, and the Central Market might not have a supply of them when you need it to.

Either by selling them to the market, or packaging them for imperial delivery, many alchemists have made a fortune. Alchemy is definitely cumbersome, but it can ensure you great profit.

This page will help guide you through some of the more detailed parts of alchemy. It will focus on preparing the ingredients needed, and how to profit from the result.If you hesitated to delve into this life skill because you thought it’s difficult, this is the chance to learn!




You have to install an alchemy tool at your residence and then put ingredients in the cauldron to perform alchemy, as explained in the Alchemy page.Wearing alchemy-related clothes will help you be more efficient with your time spent in alchemy.As you can see, the procedure itself is very simple, but it is not easy to prepare the ingredients used in alchemy.

You have to obtain them via farming, node production, or gathering them yourself.Thus, in order to perform efficient, consistent alchemy, you have to secure a certain amount of contribution points and energy beforehand.

➤ You can read more about those features of the game in the [Contribution] and [Energy] pages


Must-haves for Efficient Alchemy

1. Silver Embroidered Alchemist's Clothes
Movement Speed Level +1 and AlchemyTime: -1 sec. might not be that appealing if you haven’t enhanced these clothes yet. However, the silver embroidered alchemist's clothes are worthwhile after being enhanced.
+1: Movement Speed Level +1 & Alchemy Time: -2 sec & Alchemy EXP +10%+2: Movement Speed Level +2 & Alchemy Time: -3 sec & Alchemy EXP +15%+3: Movement Speed Level +2 & Alchemy Time: -4 sec & Alchemy EXP +20%+4: Movement Speed Level +3 & Alchemy Time: -5 sec & Alchemy EXP +25%+5: Movement Speed Level +4 & Alchemy Time: -7 sec & Alchemy EXP +40%

You can earn additional alchemy EXP by enhancing the clothes, so it is better to get them to at least +1 or +2. You can craft these clothes yourself at a costume mill town workshop, or purchase them from the Central Market.

2. Alchemy Tool
While the basic alchemy tool you can purchase at an NPC will serve its purpose for a time, you will soon require tools that can last a good amount of alchemical processes. For this, you can craft intermediate alchemy tools (durability 500) at the 3rd level of tool workshops, and advanced alchemy tools (durability 900, alchemy time: -1 sec) at the 4th level of tool workshops. For this, remember that you’ll need to collect rough stones and logs by yourself, as the market tends to always be scarce of them.


Intermediate and advanced alchemy tools are usually out of stock at the Central Market.So, if you can’t craft them yourself, purchase the normal alchemy tools (durability 100) sold in major towns.

Materials for intermediate alchemy tool:40 rough stones, 25 logs, 20 melted iron shards, 10 black stone powder.Materials for advanced alchemy tool:30 polished stones, 15 usable scantlings, 24 melted iron shards, 20 black stone powder

Additionally, if you find yourself in the Land of the Morning Light, or started your adventure there, you might want to instead craft a Morning Light Traditional Alchemy Tool. It offers the same -1 second as the advanced alchemy tool, but has a lot more durability.You can craft it in the tool workshops in the houses of Moodle Village Nampo 2 and Byeot County Village Nopsae 4.This alchemy tool requires the following materials:95 polished stones, 15 standardized timber squares, 30 iron ingots, and 30 fire horns.

3. Buffs
An alchemy stone of life, or certain dishes such as sute tea (Life EXP Gain +8%), teff bread (Cooking Time: -3%), and teff sandwich (Cooking Time: -5%) are useful for reducing time spent in alchemy.




1.  Herbs
You can obtain herbs through various ways. You can either gather herbs you see in the wild, or cultivate them in a garden. Some can also be obtained from node production by sending workers to collect them.However, the easiest way is to purchase herbs from certain vendor NPCs, though keep in mind their cost will be high.
As for weeds, the only way to gather them is with your bare hands.

You can use 1 weed instead of 1 wild grass when you’re crafting clear liquid reagent or pure powder reagent. However, for other elixirs that require wild grass, the ratio is 1 to 5 for wild grass and weeds.



Herb vendors, such as Calpheon City’s Nieves, will be your best friends when it comes to obtaining herbs.



You will see they offer the main types of herbs necessary for alchemy.

2. Beast Blood
You can gather beast blood with a fluid collector after hunting down a beast. Different blood from the same group have the same effect, so use the one that's easier to get.

Purified Water and Distilled Water, which one is better?

Purified water and distilled water are treated as the same ingredient, so get the easier one for you to obtain.Both can be earned by processing a bottle of river water. This one can be gathered by right-clicking an empty bottle while your feet are in the a or fountain. You can purchase empty bottles from a Material Vendor NPC. You can make purified water by filtering (processing) a bottle of river water, and distilled water by heating (processing) the bottle. You can carry out filtering only in a windy weather, so in those situations it is better to process the bottle into distilled water, as it requires no weather condition.

3. Gathering special ingredients
You can obtain the following ingredients at a low rate while lumbering various trees. Your gathering level should be skilled 5 or higher. You can also obtain them at a low rate by sending workers to specific lumbering nodes.But we recommend you to purchase them from the Central Market if you want to produce items that employ them at a large scale, since you may not obtain enough ingredients by gathering or through node production.

4. Powders
You can obtain the following powders at a low rate while mining various ores when your gathering level is skilled 5 or higher.Additionally, you can obtain them at a low rate in specific mining nodes, and you have to send workers to several nodes in order to have sufficient supplies. If you are still not satisfied, you can purchase them at the Central Market, and exchange your mysterious catalysts, a byproduct of alchemical synthesis, for them.

5. Traces
Traces are very scarce, since the only way to obtain them is through node production, as an additional rare item obtained from gathering, and as a drop from certain types of monsters. Even though some monsters may drop traces at a very low rate, you cannot rely on it as a source of ingredients. Therefore, you need to produce it with your workers for a steady supply and get the rest from the Central Market.

You can obtain sap by using a fluid collector tool on trees, or through node production.We recommend that you gather it yourself because you can obtain a large amount of it, and they are easy to find. Node production is not the best way since it has low rates of earning sap, and it takes a long time.

Daily Alchemy Quest from the Town of Olvia

You can receive repeatable quests from the town of Olvia when your alchemy level reaches beginner 10. They are convenient since you can prepare all ingredients beforehand and complete the quests all at once. Also, since you can receive contribution and alchemy EXP and recover energy as a reward, it is the perfect way to level up your alchemy.




If you only want the increase in profit when turning in boxes of packed alchemy elixirs, we recommend you swap your equipment for the pieces that increase alchemy mastery only for the time you spend turning in the boxes.



It requires some time and effort to complete these quests, but for rewards, you can obtain contribution EXP, alchemy EXP, as well as rare items like hard & sharp black crystal shards. We also recommend that you proceed with advancement quests, called leap quests, to help you reach a higher alchemy level quicker. You can accept the first leap quest once you reach the alchemy level beginner 10.Once you’re at this alchemy level, summon the Black Spirit and check its guide menu, where you can find the available leap quests for all life skills. You can be guided to the NPC you can receive the quests from more easily by simply pressing them from the list.



*The content of the game guide may differ from the actual game content, depending on the update and content changes.

Subtópico: Processing
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
There is a variety of life skill content available within the world of Black Desert. You can harvest potatoes and other produce from a farm, or go fishing down the waterside. You can cut down trees and gather timber, or collect sap from them. You can hunt wild animals both on land and at sea, and from them acquire hides and meat.
From these resources, you can craft various items and even the specialty of each town for use in trading. That’s when the processing life skill comes into play.


Out of all the life skills, processing is the act of changing the properties or form of materials you obtain through simple procedures.

Processing may sound similar to cooking or alchemy, in the sense that existing materials are used to create a new product, but there is an important difference.The output of processing is not the complete end product, but is instead used as an advanced material for other life skills, such as cooking and alchemy.

Open the Processing window (hotkey: L), select the type of processing, and then insert the required items to start the action. However, remember that you must have at least 2 free slots in your inventory, and that your character must be under its weight carrying capacity limit.



Although processing does not have any special requirements for the most part, there are some types that are affected by the weather, such as drying which can only be done on clear days, and filtering which requires wind to be present in the area. Repair, which is carried out indoors, requires that you have an anvil installed at your residence.

Items made through processing are often used as materials for cooking, alchemy, and workshop crafting.



Right click an item to select it from your inventory, and then press the start button to begin processing it.



There are several types of processing options. Select the desired type of processing from the Processing window and you will see that knowledge acquired through processing will become active in the Processing Knowledge list, allowing you to check the recipe for these.

The different types of processing are the following:















Additionally, there is also a chance you will acquire a higher grade product when before you wouldn’t. For example, iron ore is heated to produce melted iron shards, and these shards are in turn heated to obtain iron ingots. When you’re heating iron ore with a high processing level, you will not only acquire melted iron shards, but also have a chance to acquire iron ingots directly.

As a last note, remember that you can’t carry out any processing when your weight reaches 100% of your weight capacity limit, so it is difficult to do mass processing actions with all the materials inside your inventory. In these situations, for convenience one can find a character costume in the Pearl Shop to be able to carry out processing actions with the materials still in storage.



When you’re processing materials you might see a message from time to time saying something similar to “the process is not going as planned,” or “processing is taking longer than usual.” A processing action being successful or not depends on one’s processing success rate.

Keep in mind that failing a processing action does not incur any loss of materials. It is a simple matter of the time taken to complete the action. It also has no effect on the number of produced materials, or their quality.



If one finds themselves taking a long time to process a given material, know that there are several ways to increase the processing success rate. Wearing silver embroidered craftsman’s clothes, activating certain alchemy stones, and consuming  specific dishes, elixirs, and draughts will help greatly increase the success rate for processing.



To craft a higher grade item using processing, one does not only need specific materials crafted through alchemy, such as metal solvent or plywood hardener, but also need the beginner and/or skilled knowledge certificates of that type of processing to successfully carry out the action.

If one tries to process an item without the relevant knowledge entry certificate, then they will not be able to get any product from the processing action.

The beginner certificate can be acquired by Adventurers with a processing level of Apprentice Lv. 4 or higher, by accepting and completing the quests from the NPCs listed below.

However, the type of quests to be seen by an Adventurer, as specified at the bottom of the Quest window (hotkey: O), must include the Life option in order to be able to accept these quests. Therefore, it is advised that one examines whether the All option is selected before talking to the NPC.

As the skilled certificates are of a higher tier than the beginner ones, the conditions for accessing their quests are more demanding, and it is more difficult to acquire them.
Most of the quests are carried out in the territory of Calpheon, and as for the certificate for skilled shaking, it can be acquired as a challenge reward once one reaches the artisan processing level. As seen below, this means one cannot obtain the certificates for skilled grinding and filtering before reaching processing artisan.

As a summary, one begins by first obtaining all the beginner certificates, and then they can obtain the skilled certificates for the various types of processing in order, starting with the heating one. The last three (shaking, grinding, and filtering) require reaching artisan processing to acquire them, or to unlock the quests to do so.



Each one of the life skills has a mastery value tied to it, which depends on the life skill level of the character and other variables, such as equipment increasing it. This mastery lets one perform the life skill’s action better, or obtain better results from it.

The increase in processing mastery allows one to carry out mass processing actions on a large scale, processing several batches of the same item at once. For example, if usually the procedure of processing iron ore takes x5 iron ore per processing sequence, one’s mastery may allow them to process x20 batches at the same time. The time it takes to complete the sequence is longer, but shorter than it would take to process them individually. This way, given the example above, one can process x100 iron ore for each single processing action.

To carry out mass processing, one requires a processing stone. Green grade processing stones are sold by NPCs Camellia Loggia and Zaaira, in Balenos, while blue grade ones are sold by NPCs Zaaira in Velia, Techthon in Heidel, and several others throughout the world.
For a yellow grade one, however, one needs to craft it themselves, or purchase it from the Central Market. You can craft it via the manufacture processing option with the following materials: Moonlight Opal x30, Gem Polisher x15, Manos Stone x5, and Magical Shard x50

Once a processing stone has been equipped, the Mass Process option will be enabled in the Processing window.



Accessing the Life Skill tab of the character profile (hotkey: P), one can hover over the processing section to see how many batches of a processing action they can carry out at once.



Once this has been checked, acquire the materials to process, press Mass Process, and once the action has been completed the result will be seen.



In this example, out of 1,000 units of birch timber, a single processing action has used 235 units of them, or seen another way, 47 times the normal 5 units it would process normally.



One can accept processing-related quests from a variety of NPCs in the world of Black Desert.First, we recommend that you proceed with the processing quests you can find in Balenos, the first territory most Adventurers explore.

It requires some time and effort to complete these quests, but for rewards, you can obtain contribution EXP, processing EXP, as well as rare items like hard & sharp black crystal shards. We also recommend that you proceed with advancement quests, called leap quests, to help you reach a higher processing level quicker. You can accept the first leap quest once you reach the processing level beginner Lv. 10.Once you’re at this processing level, summon the Black Spirit and check its guide menu, where you can find the available leap quests for all life skills. You can be guided to the NPC you can receive the quests from more easily by simply pressing them from the list.

In Black Desert, where Adventurers journey across a vast continent, horses are essential.Their fast speed and strong stamina make them ideal for long-distance travel, and there’s something too appealing about the sense of speed you get when sprinting through the wind.Additionally, the varied uses of horse skills and horseback combat, among other things, make the horse a real companion for adventure.

Thus, owning a horse is not optional, but a necessity.In this page, we'll take a look at everything, from how to tame a horse, to how to raise it into a mighty steed.



You can go about anywhere within the world of Black Desert if you’ve got a horse.

Horses can be obtained by purchasing a horse emblem from a Stable Keeper NPC. However, it may be difficult to make that horse into a superstar as only tier 1 horses can be obtained through this method.
You may be better off seeking out wild horses that roam freely throughout the world, as they can quickly be tamed and turned into tier 6 to 7 horses.
You can distinguish the tier of a wild horse by its appearance. A muscular horse is higher in tier than a slim horse.

There are a couple of materials you will need to tame a wild horse: capturing rope, and several lumps of raw sugar.
Heating (hotkey: L) on:

(Raw Sugar x10) and

(Mineral Water x1)

Both ingredients can be purchased from vendors who sell food ingredients.


◈ Horse-Taming Minigame

Right click on a capturing rope in your inventory (hotkey: I) and approach a wild horse with the rope equipped. Press LMB when your cursor is aligned with the horse to throw the rope. Then press Space to reign in the horse and start the minigame.



When the mini-game starts, press Space over the blue portion of the gauge to begin wrangling the horse.



Press W to advance and continue taming the horse using your rope. When it stands on its hind legs, the red gauge must be maintained at 50% or higher by pressing Space repeatedly.



After successfully winning the tug-of-war and getting within reach of the horse, the Interact menu will be activated. Instead of mounting the horse right away, feed them lumps of raw sugar. Even if you feed the horse with only one lump of raw sugar, you will definitely succeed in capturing it.

Tips to succeed on taming a horse!

1. Don’t throw the rope when the horse is on top of a rock or obstacle. Mounting in this situation has a high probability of failing.

2. There are times where the horse rears up while you are approaching it. In this case, succeed on the tug-of-war by pressing Space several times.

3. Even if you just use one lump of raw sugar, it will definitely make you succeed in capturing the horse!

4. Captured horses can be used after registering them at a stable. Tame it after checking empty slots in nearby stables. Please note that the horse will disappear if you log in again without registering it.

5. Since the captured horse is slow, switch to a horse that you brought along with you. The captured horse will follow along behind you.

◈ Wild Horse Locations

Wild horses can be found everywhere within the world of Black Desert.Most wild horses are tier 6, but you can occasionally find tier 7 horses as well.You have a notably higher chance to find a tier 7 wild horse in Drieghan.

Breeding your captured wild horse will lead to future generations of fine horses.

In the locations below you will find where to tame wild horses.These locations will be helpful in your taming pursuits, but they are not the only locations where you will stumble upon wild horses on your adventures.

Please press the name of each territory to see the list of locations.




As you travel around on your horse, your horse will gain experience based on the distance that is traveled.Your horse will level up as it obtains experience, and this is when its stats will increase by bit.

Although two horses may be the same level, they have different stats. The details of each stat are explained below.

Speed
Determines how fast the horse will run. The higher the speed, the faster it will run.
Acceleration
The higher the acceleration, the shorter it will take your horse to reach its maximum speed.
Turn
Affects how your horse will turn while running. The higher the running speed, the shorter the turning radius.
Brake
Affects how quickly the horse can stop. Higher brake will allow the horse to stop faster.

The growth direction can be predicted based on the base stats of the horse at level 1. The types of horse are as follows:
- Agile: Speedy horses possess high speed and acceleration, with their highest growth being in those areas.- Control: Drifters have high brake and turn stats, with their highest growth being in those areas.- Balance: Balanced horses have stats that are balanced all around including their growth.




Breeding Count
Stallions can breed twice, and mares can only breed once.
You can reset a horse’s breeding count with the Horse Breeding Reset option.
Remaining Time
Only applies to event horses.
It means the horse can only be used during a certain period of time.
Brand
You can brand a horse with a Mount Brand Spell Stone item, which increases the chance of the horse learning a skill every time they level up while branded.


◈ Resurrecting Horses

When your horse has died, you can go to the closest Stable Keeper NPC and revive it.However, you can also revive the horse on the spot by using the Tears of the Wind item.The horse will be revived with full health and stamina at that location.

Tears of the wind do not only apply to horses, but also to all personal mounts, such as a miniature elephants and Epheria sailboats.It will be a useful just-in-case item to keep in your inventory.



This item can be obtained from the Loyalties tab of the Pearl Shop, and costs 500 loyalties.



When a horse levels up, it can learn a new skill at a set probability.The skills that a horse can learn depend on the tier and type of the horse.Check in your horse into a stable to view the list of available skills for a horse.Click on the horse to view the skill window on the right side of the screen.

Lastly, for the “S” skills specific to tier 8 horses, previous skills must be learned before these can be acquired.

◈ Skill Training Minigame

After you’ve learned the skills, a minigame will appear at a set probability when you use the skills. Completing the minigames will increase your proficiency with the skill.You may be launched off your horse upon failing the minigame, but if successful at the game, you will earn greater proficiency with that skill.When you have acquired 100% proficiency with the skill, the minigames will no longer appear.




As you reach a higher training level, your horse will gain more EXP, and your chances of taming a wild horse will be increased. You do not need to worry about increasing your training level, as this will naturally occur as you raise your horses. You can also speed up this process through taming wild horses.


◈ Leveling a Horse

The quickest way to raise your horse is to travel around with it manually, but it is also recommended that you set up looped auto-pathing during the times when you’re not playing the game.

Hold the Alt key while on the World Map screen and right-click to set the destination of an auto-pathing route. Then right click to your current location to create a looped route.Alternatively, right click on a location in the world map, and then press the Set Loop button that appears below.

While holding the Alt key you can also right click other locations to add checkpoints and extend the auto-pathing route.

The auto-pathed route is indicated in green, so check the color to make sure it has been set up properly.

After you’ve mounted your horse, press the T key to automatically travel through the marked path and activate the function to auto-feed your horse carrots. If you have enough carrots in your inventory, you will find yourself automatically moving back and forth on the set route while using carrots to automatically recover stamina.

Straight paths are the best as auto-pathed routes, but be mindful of the potential threat of being killed by another Adventurer (PK-ed). It is wise to set a shorter route between towns, or even within a single town.

Value Pack

You can also increase the horse’s EXP gain by using elixirs, such as the elixir of training, but these have a short duration and it does not increase the EXP significantly, so it is best to use it when truly necessary.



You can tame and raise a wild horse, but the fastest way to obtain a good horse is via the horse market. It can be accessed via the stable keepers in big cities, the world map (hotkey: M), and the main menu (hotkey: Esc) → Life (F6) → Horse Market.

Horses at the horse market are traded differently from the Central Market.Horse prices will be automatically calculated according to the horse’s tier and level, remaining breeding counts, current skills, and other factors. It is very important to make a smart purchase when it comes to buying a horse.Make sure to check the remaining breeding counts if your main purpose is breeding, and purchase a Lv. 1 horse with a decent tier.It is mandatory to check stats and skills if you don’t want to train your horse.Same goes for selling horses.

While you may receive more money for selling a higher-level horse, it also involves the risk of not being sold if it hasn’t acquired a good selection of skills.Be mindful about who your sales target might be, or you can simply supply the horse to the imperial court via the imperial horse delivery option at a Stable Keeper NPC in a major city.


Breeding can only be carried out through the breeding market available at certain stables.Only stallions with remaining breeding counts can be registered on the breeding market.

First, select a mare and press the Request Breeding option to select a stallion you wish to breed with.

Remember that you need to choose a mare with remaining breed counts for the Request Breeding option to be usable.

During this process, the owner of the mare will have to pay a breeding fee to the owner of the stallion.You can also choose to breed among your own horses by checking the Show Only Me option when you register the stallion on the breeding market. This way, the stallion will only be visible to you in the My Registrations tab, and you can request to carry on with the breeding process.

After some time has passed after breeding, you will receive a foal. However, be mindful that a mount slot must be available in the stable in order to receive your foal. Lastly, the stats of the foal are affected by the tier and level of their parents, so it’s best to be mindful of this and utilize your horses to your advantage.

Please note that the stats of the foal are not only impacted by the level of the parents, but their skills as well.In the case that the parent horses have acquired great skills such as Sprint, Instant Accel, etc., the chances of the foal being born into a fine horse will also increase! Also be mindful that if you get really lucky, you may even receive a fine tier 8 horse from breeding two 6 tier horses at level 30.

However, horses with a level above 30 will not have their breeding odds increased.

Sometimes an imperial steed can be born in a stable when breeding according to a certain probability.Imperial steeds can grow up to Lv. 15, and can be used for imperial delivery.When providing your imperial steed for imperial delivery, you can obtain 120,000,000 silver and better rewards than by supplying normal horses.

◈ More Details Regarding Imperial Steeds
Imperial steeds are born with the Imperial Stature skill, but cannot learn any other skill.

They cannot be sold to NPC vendors, or registered for horse exchange, at the breeding market, or at the horse market.

The higher the tier and level of the stallions and mares being bred, the higher chance of obtaining an imperial steed. However, the chance of obtaining an imperial steed does not increase after level 31.

The chance of obtaining an imperial steed is not influenced by your character’s training level or mastery.
Imperial steeds can only be obtained from breeding. They cannot be obtained from horse exchange.

Imperial steeds cannot use the following items: Mount Brand Spell Stone, Mount Skill Change Coupon, Mount Skill Selection Coupon, Mount Skill Training Coupon, Mount All Skill Training Coupon, Horse Appearance Change Coupon, Premium Horse Appearance Change Coupon, Reset Mount Growth, or Mount Name Change Coupon.

Exchange works like breeding. You can only use it with stabled horses, but the horses used in the exchange process will disappear.

A horse obtained from the exchange is influenced by their parents, just like a foal gained from breeding.

It is a common option to exchange a horse with no more breeding counts, since there is a breeding count limit.



When a horse reaches Lv. 15, the Imperial Horse Delivery option will become available at the stable.

The price will be lower than selling it on the Central Market, but it will be exchanged for silver right away, and lets you obtain golden seals for imperial training depending on the tier. These seals can then be exchanged for other items.


You can obtain the above shown items and silver as rewards upon delivering a horse to the imperial court.

The following items, as seen above, can be exchanged at NPC Breesman, in Calpheon City.

Additionally, you can exchange x1 of these golden seals at NPC Shamhain in the Stonetail Horse Ranch, Mediah, to obtain swaying wind shards and rumbling earth shards, used for awakening a courser into a dream horse, and x12 with Variel at the Old Wisdom Tree, Kamasylvia, for Powder of Ascension x1, which is required to complete a quest to obtain mythical feathers, needed for the mythical awakening process, the step after obtaining a dream horse.

Lastly, you can also exchange x5 or x15 of these seals with any stable keeper in the territory of Valencia to obtain the two types of camels currently available.

➤ You can read more about the different types of these seals in the [Golden Seals] page.



A horse that learns Charge, Drift, and other certain skills will be classified as a courser.When a horse becomes a courser, all breeding market / horse market / imperial delivery prices will significantly increase compared to normal horses.

Additionally, a foal born from two courser breeding will be born with 2 inherited skills, while a foal born from breeding a courser and a normal horse will be able to have up to 2 inherited skills.

Have a horse learn certain skills according to their tier and this icon will change to gold, unlike the normal silver icon of regular horses.

A tier 8 courser has more benefits.It can go through courser training via NPC Gula in Stonetail Horse Ranch, Mediah. After completing courser training, it can attempt awakening to be reborn as one of the fabled dream horses, majestic horses with special abilities. There are three types of dream horses: Arduanatt, Diné, and Doom, the 3 offspring of Krogdalo, the King of Celestial Horses.
Tier
Courser Skills (Classified “Courser” upon learning all skills)
Tier 1-2
Charge
Tier 3-4
Charge, Drift
Tier 5-6
Charge, Drift, Sprint
Tier 7
Charge, Drift, Sprint, Instant Accel, Sideways
Tier 8
Charge, Drift, Sprint, Instant Accel, Sideways, S: Instant Accel, S: Sideways


You can think of tier 8 coursers as the prep stage for obtaining dream horses.

For example, Arduanatt is much higher in speed, acceleration, turn, and brake stats compared to a tier 8 horse. Also, its special ability allows it to glide in the air with its massive wings. Another dream horse, Diné, can run through the desert without any movement speed reduction penalty, while other horses cannot. It cannot only run but also use all its skills while there.

The last dream horse, Doom, possesses great destructive power thanks to the flames emanating from it, allowing it to assist its rider in battle.



You need special materials for courser training. These are: Pure Forest Breath, Rainbow Gem Fruit, Breezy Conch Seaweed, Deep Blue Hoof Root, Stonetail Fodder, and Spirit Pouch of Ferocious Beast. They are obtainable by carrying out life skill activities, such as gathering and fishing, or by defeating monsters.

Use these materials to increase a courser’s skill, elegance, and strength.When all training categories add up to 200%, the courser can now attempt dream horse awakening.

You have to feed the courser at least two of the following materials to reach a total of 200% in training.

Above you can see the Courser Training UI. Train each category (Skill, Elegance, Strength) to reach a total of 200% in training.

When reaching 200% across all Skill, Elegance and Strength categories, prepare a Krogdalo's Origin Stone to attempt awakening.

Process via simple alchemy Swaying Wind Shard x25 and Rumbling Earth Shard x25 that can be obtained from exchanging imperial training golden seals, horse race seals, peridot leaves, and Old Moon Grand Prix coins, to obtain Krogdalo's Origin Stone x1.

One stone will be consumed for every awakening attempt.



Please note that the percentage of Skill, Elegance and Strength will reset when failing an awakening attempt. Only 50% of the total training percentage will disappear when failing an awakening attempt using cron stones (but any decimal amounts will be removed).Every time you fail, the chance to succeed in future awakening attempts will increase.

When you succeed in awakening, your tier 8 courser will be reborn as one of the three dream horses: Arduanatt, Diné, or Doom.

Arduanatt has 3 unique skills from birth:Courser's Spirit, which automatically recovers HP and stamina little by little when unmounted, Double Jump, and Wings of Wind for gliding.

As you level up, your horse can learn skills according to a certain probability.

Diné is born with Earth of Life, which recovers 300 HP as well as 300 MP/WP/SP every 3 seconds for 60 seconds for the owner and up to 9 of their allies, along with the skills Courser's Spirit and Double Jump.

Doom is born with Dark Flame Steps, a powerful melee attack that can inflict flame damage to nearby enemies, as well as Courser’s Spirit and Double Jump.Additionally, the skill Dark Sprint can be learned according to a certain probability.Dark Sprint is a skill in which you can move faster during S: Instant Accel and inflicts damage to nearby enemies, surrounding them with flames.On top of that, Doom is the only dream horse that can learn the Two-seater skill.



For those that wonder if they have reached the pinnacle of horse training by obtaining the three dream horses, even more awe-inspiring horses await them in the form of the mythical horses.

You will need to use 2 dream horses to obtain a mythical horse. Please check the [Mythical Horses] page to learn more about them and how to obtain them.

The British economist Adam Smith argued that the economic development of a society or nation is restricted by the size of its market. In other words, the economy cannot develop further if the size of the market is too small.

This idea is not restricted to the real world alone. The world of Black Desert is set in a fantasy world inspired by the European Middle Ages and its early modern period, and it has markets between nations and between the different landmasses. This means that there is a big market with huge potential for growth.

In the economy of a game, it is very important that there is a balance between the production and consumption of money. The currency used in the world of Black Desert is silver, traded in the form of coins, and the major sources of production of this currency include defeating monsters, selling miscellaneous items, and several types of exchanges. Trade also plays a major role in the production of silver. On the contrary, the major consumption of silver includes purchasing various items from NPC shops, and the Central Market’s commission. In the current economic world of Black Desert, the production of silver is slightly ahead of the consumption. As such, trade plays an important role in the economy of the game, yet it’s not something grand that requires expert knowledge or special conditions. It has been created so that anyone can earn silver easily, so it’s not that difficult to manage as long as you know the basics. We will now take a detailed look at the trading system of Black Desert. If you invest a moment of your time to read this page, then you will find yourself a candidate to become a wealthy merchant in no time at all.





In the world of Black Desert, trade literally refers to the exchange of trade goods with certain NPCs. You can either acquire trade goods from defeating monsters, completing quests, purchasing them from certain Trade Manager NPCs, gathering them from the environment, or crafting them yourself via a town workshop. The fish caught through fishing is also classified as a trade good.

Unlike other items, trade goods will always come with its origin point, and a distance bonus will be calculated based on the distance between the origin point and the NPC you sell it to. In other words, you can earn more from selling a trade good to a trader NPC who is further away from its origin point.

But just trying to sell it as far away as possible is not always the best. In order for the value of the trade good to be properly appreciated, the node of the origin point and the town you’re trying to sell it to must be connected. Thus, you will need to invest in nodes and also consider the traveling time between the two locations as well.

If your purpose is to do more than just trade, then it is essential to find out how you can trade most efficiently.In order to achieve this, there are a few key words that you must understand. They are explored in the next few sections.



Trade goods can only be purchased at designated nodes, and can only be sold in the main town or city of each territory.Additionally, you cannot sell a trade good in the same territory you’ve purchased it in.

You can purchase trade goods in the following nodes:


Once purchased, trade goods will be added to that node’s order contract log, and can be retrieved at any time to your inventory or mount inventory.



A one-time standby fee is incurred immediately after purchase, and an additional fee is added every 4 hours from the time of purchase. You can see this silver quantity next to Storage Fee. In exchange for this fee, your purchased trade goods will not have their price altered. More on this below in the Price Guarantee Time section.

The standby fee will be deducted from your silver upon retrieving the items, and you must pay the indicated sum in order to retrieve them.

Please note that each node’s order contract log only allows for a maximum of 20,000LT of weight. At 300LT per trade good, you can store a maximum of around 66 trade goods per node.However, keep in mind that only 5 different kinds of items can be stored per location.Trade goods stored in the order contract log are separated by both type of item and remaining warranty time.

Example in which 3 out of 5 slots are used:• Velia Wine x15 stored (Warranty period: 5 days)• Velia Wine x10 stored (Warranty period: 2 days)• Fox Fur x10 stored (Warranty period: 7 days)

As seen above, Velia Wine will take different slots if purchased at different times.

The order contract log of each of the nodes above can be managed by interacting with the trade manager in that location.



The node between the origin point and the place a trade good is being sold at must be connected. If they’re not, then the trade good can only be sold for 30% of the original price.

Additionally, trade goods cannot be purchased from trade managers in unconnected isolated nodes.



Please keep in mind that this node connection penalty does not affect fish. You can obtain it from anywhere in the world and sell it at any location, regardless of node connection, and it will sell at its appropriate price.



A distance bonus is accumulated relative to the distance the trade good moves between its origin point and sale point. Thus, you will receive a higher price when you sell it as far away as possible, but you must consider the time it takes to travel as well as the contribution points you need to use to connect the nodes.

While fish is not affected by the lack of node connection penalty, it is affected by the distance bonus. This means that the farther away you sell the acquired fish, the better.


The market price refers to the price that the trade good is sold and purchased at.It rises or falls based on a probability every day at 02:00, 06:00, 10:00, 14:00, 18:00, and 22:00 (UTC), and can increase or decrease by max 15% of their base value.

General trade goods such as ancient gold coins do not fluctuate in price, and in the case of fish, the cost can increase by up to 130% and decrease by as little as 80%.

In the case of trade goods that can be purchased from Trade Manager NPCs, their purchase & sale price can increase up to 300% (3 times their base price), and decrease to as low as 30%.The fluctuating market price of these trade goods is applied equally to all servers.


In addition, at every fixed time specified above, a special price fluctuation in which the market price of trade goods changes significantly takes place.When a special fluctuation occurs, the current price can increase by up to 200% (twice the price), or decrease by up to 50%.

Please note that special price fluctuations will occur after the 15% market price changes, which occur every 4 hours at 02:00, 06:00, 10:00, 14:00, 18:00, and 22:00 (UTC).Market prices will change by each territory and category of trade item. Such categories are: General Goods, Luxury, Food, Medicine, Military Supply, Relic, Clothing, and Raw Material.

Before special price fluctuations occur, information can be gathered in advance to predict the change in market prices. You can check rumors in the Old Moon Guild Newsletter window, accessed through the Life (F6) tab in the main menu (hotkey: Esc).Operated by the Old Moon Guild, these rumors may or may not be applied 4 hours upon circulating, or may even be incorrect.This can be confirmed directly by checking the residents of each territory who are gathered in town commenting their ideas and pondering what to do.

For example, when there is a rumor that the price of Calpheonian general goods is expected to skyrocket, you can witness in person the conversation in front of the eagle statue in Calpheon where you’ll find people complaining about the difficulty in obtaining materials.

This is the expiration date for a trade good. When a trade good is purchased, it is kept stored in that node’s order contract log. You have a 7-day price guarantee period from the time of purchase. If the goods are not retrieved within the contract period, they will be sold at 25% of the original price, and the price of the forced sale will be paid after deducting the standby fee.

When the trade goods are retrieved from the order contract, they will have a 3-hour validity period regardless of the contract period. During the 3-hour validity period, retrieved trade goods will not be affected by price drops that occur during the remaining validity period.

Thus, once you retrieve a trade good, you need to sell it as soon as possible before the 3 hours have passed, as you cannot return the trade good to the order contract log once it has been retrieved.

In order to sell trade goods to other territories, you must right-click them to take them out of the order contract log and store them in your inventory or mount’s inventory. When this happens, the price guarantee period will be reduced to 3 hours.

Regarding fish, the price guarantee time works differently. Overall, it will gradually depreciate until it reaches 0% value of the original price after 24 hours. This means that after a day has passed the fish you’ve acquired will expire and become worthless.

Note that thanks to the colder temperatures in the region, fish from the surroundings of the Mountain of Eternal Winter last for longer than 24 hours.



This is a minigame where you bargain with the Trade Manager NPC you’re selling the trade good or fish to.You will consume 5 energy for each attempt, but if you are successful, you will be able to sell your trade goods and fish at an increased price. Energy is naturally recharged as you travel, so it’s always good to bargain every time you get the chance.

The higher your trading level, the higher the bargain profit will be.






There are trade goods that require a certain trading life skill level to be reached before you can purchase them. Each node has restricted trade goods that can only be obtained once you’ve reached the trading life skill levels of skilled 1, professional 1, and artisan 1.


The limit quantity that can be delivered. In normal trading, there is no limit. The Trade Manager NPCs in major towns will accept all the trade goods you have for sale.For imperial fishing delivery, the server's delivery quantity is reset every 3 hours from 00:00 (UTC) real time.In the case of imperial crafting delivery, there is no delivery quantity limit per server, but per family. The daily delivery quantity limit per family is set at 1/2 of your maximum contribution points.

➤ You can read more about contribution points in the [Contribution] pages.


A huge mysterious merchant guild has appeared, and they buy all the cheaper trade goods to sell them later when the prices stabilize.If the mysterious merchant guild buys up all the stock, there will be a shortage of trade goods for a while, and the prices will remain stable for a certain period of time.After the shortage ends and demand increases, the prices will rise, and this merchant guild will sell their stock, making it possible to purchase trade goods again.

In simpler terms, when market prices for trade goods stay within 40% of the original price for three market cycles (12 hours), a purchase restriction is applied. Trade goods cannot be purchased, and the market price will not fluctuate for 3 days. Purchased trade goods can still be sold.After 3 days pass, the market prices for trade goods reset to the original price.







Currently, the best wagon for trading is the wonderful forest path wagon with 22 inventory slots. However, it’s quite difficult to obtain, and thus may not be appropriate for a beginner.

Instead, you can craft a noble wagon, or a merchant wagon, by getting the materials yourself.While you can attempt to purchase a wagon registration permit from another Adventurer in the Central Market, you will often find no wagon listed for sale.

You will need contribution points to purchase the necessary house to use as a wagon workshop, and workers to do the crafting for you.The materials you can obtain yourself, or task workers to acquire most of them for you via node production.

The merchant wagon can be crafted in Altinova, in the house no. 5-8.The noble wagon can be crafted in various towns. For example, in the same house as the trade wagon in Altinova, and in Calpheon City in the workshop district 1-6, first floor.

When purchasing a residence, keep in mind the amount of contribution points required. In the case above, the house itself only costs 3 contribution points, but unlocking its purchase by purchasing all required houses costs up to 11 points.

Additionally, some of the materials you will need require the Processing - Beginner knowledge. This can be acquired only by reaching a certain level in processing, and then carrying out a series of quests.

➤ You can read more about these quests in the [Processing] page.

For example, the materials that require this kind of knowledge include brass ingot, sturdy pine plywood and fine soft hide, which are required to craft a noble wagon. However, don’t be stressed, since it is rather easy to obtain the required processing level, and the related quests are quite easy as well.
Wagons are consumables, so you will need a new one when the durability wears out in order to continue trading. Thus, it is better to craft more than one wagon in preparation for the future. Of course, selling those you don’t need at the Central Market is also a good idea.

Some of the wagons that can be crafted in each wagon workshop
Level 1
Strong wagon
10 inventory slots
1 Wagon Horse, 5 Maple Plywood, 5 Iron Ingot,
5 Tough Hide, 15 Black Stone Powder
Level 2
Merchant wagon
18 inventory slots
4 Wagon Horse, 12 Acacia Plywood, 12 Brass Ingot,
12 Soft Hide, 25 Black Stone Powder
Level 3

An imperial delivery is when you supply goods that are needed by the imperial court. There are several types: selling horses, packaged dishes & elixirs, and fish.Since the items are being sought after by the imperial court, their market value is fixed at 250% of their market price. This applies to packaged dishes & elixirs and fish.

Imperial crafting delivery involves packaging a box of a specific item and supplying it to the aforementioned imperial court. This means that you’ll be crafting a trade good and delivering it, rather than buying it from a Trade Manager NPC like you normally do during trading. It requires a lot of preparation and effort, but you can earn a large amount of silver this way.

The imperial crafting delivery resets on a daily basis (server time).

➤ You can read more about this in the [Imperial Crafting Delivery] page.



For fish, as explained in a previous section, the delivery quantity is reset every 3 hours from 00:00 (UTC) real time every day on all servers.



This refers to selling various types of crates that can be crafted in a town workshop.The advantages are that the ingredients can be gathered by your workers, and the crate items can be stacked in the local town storage. You can also set the origin point of the item quite freely, and earn big amounts of silver through trade by using the fact that delivery is always available.

You can have an unlimited workforce by giving beer to your workers. This is an efficient method that many Adventurers use.

Trading processed items is a simple process. You just need to craft crates from the various workbenches (wood, mineral, crop, mushroom, fish) and sell them.The most important thing here is the town that workers are affiliated with. This is because the origin point of the item will not be determined by the location of the workshop, but the village where the worker is from.

The materials also need to be within the storage of the town that the worker is part of, as the system involves the worker taking the materials from their own town to the workshop and crafting the item there. (The crafting duration, however, will be lower if the workshop is located in the town of the worker.)



◈ Distance Bonus Between Major Towns (%)
This is the distance bonus applied to general trade goods and fish.Trade goods that can be obtained through Trade Manager NPC purchases can receive a distance bonus equivalent to approximately 8.8% of the value in the table below.

Subtópico: Imperial Crafting Delivery

You can find the Imperial Crafting Delivery NPCs in each of the main towns.

It’s a good idea to have your packed items, or the items that need to be packaged, in a town’s storage that is close to an Imperial Crafting Delivery NPC.

You need to pack your items, be them dishes or elixirs, before you can sell them to the imperial crafting delivery managers.As said at the beginning of the page, you can use the processing imperial cuisine function to pack dishes into cooking boxes, and the imperial alchemy one to pack elixirs into alchemy boxes. These two functions will convert the initial items into tradable goods that can only be sold to an imperial crafting delivery manager.

Please refer to the example below:

Cook or purchase x18 pickled vegetables → Process them with the imperial cuisine processing option to package them → The dishes are converted into a single professional’s cooking box → Sell this cooking box to an Imperial Craft Delivery NPC for profit.

➤ You can read more about the cooking and alchemy life skills in the [Cooking] and [Alchemy] pages.

➤ You can read more about contribution points in the [Contribution] page.


Your cooking and alchemy life skill levels must be appropriate in order to pack dishes and elixirs into certain box types.
For example, you can prepare a meat stew at the cooking level of beginner 1. However, your cooking level must be professional 1 or higher in order to convert meat stew into a professional’s cooking box.

If your cooking and alchemy levels are below the required for the cooking boxes you want to prepare, you will need to level up the life skills before you can proceed to sell the dishes & elixirs this way.

Subtópico: Golden Seal
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
You may have obtained a golden seal during your adventures. If you’re curious about these items, read all about them here!

You can obtain golden seals by selling specific trade goods and horses to Imperial Delivery NPCs, supervising workers, and from other various activities. You can exchange these seals for useful items such as black essences, horse equipment, mounts, and many more.

Simply put, Adventurers need to actively take part in various in-game activities (like trading, fishing, etc.) in order to acquire golden seals.



You may see Adventurers occasionally show items they’ve obtained, both old and new, in chat. As such, you may have seen a green-grade shiny golden seal item tooltip (second row in the picture above). These are the previous iteration of the golden seals one can obtain nowadays. The current iteration of this series of items are the yellow-grade golden seals (first row, item shown to the left).


Adventurers can get golden seals by selling specific trade goods, horses, and fish to certain Imperial Delivery NPCs. Aside from selling items to NPCs, certain types of golden seals can be acquired by defeating bandits that appear to threaten trade routes, and others by simply having workers collect materials for you.

Some of the golden seals are guaranteed to be obtained in a 1:1 ratio exchange. For example, each cooking box sold to an Imperial Crafting Delivery NPC will net you an imperial cuisine golden seal. However, this is not the case for all the activities one can partake in to get seals. If you sell 5 fish to an Imperial Fishing Delivery NPC to obtain imperial fishing delivery golden seals, you are not guaranteed to get 5 seals.

The following sections will detail how to acquire each type of golden seal currently available.



As seen above, a family can sell a limited amount of items through imperial crafting delivery per day. The good news is that you don’t have to compete with other Adventurers in this type of imperial delivery, as there is no limit to the boxes the NPCs can receive. As such, you can prepare the boxes to turn in beforehand, or take your time and prepare them whenever you want to sell them.

The higher the grade of the box you sell, the more silver you’ll earn. To package boxes of a higher grade you will need to level up its related life skill. As an example, if you want to sell professional’s cooking boxes, your character must have reached the cooking level of professional 1 at the very least.

Additionally, both your character’s cooking and alchemy mastery play a part in the silver you obtain from selling boxes to an Imperial Crafting Delivery NPC. The higher the mastery in those life skills, the more extra profit you’ll obtain!

Lastly, you might see that the item description of all cooking and alchemy boxes tell you about how to mass package them. Complete the requirements listed there and you will be able to pack up dishes and elixirs 10 times as fast as you normally would.

Imperial conquest differs from other golden seals. We mentioned before how you can get many of these seals by selling goods (packaged boxes, fish, horses). However, for these seals, Adventurers have to deal with bandits on the road in order to directly acquire the imperial conquest seals as items dropped by them upon defeat.

You will see in the World Map screen (hotkey: M) that several red bandit icons are constantly on the move.

If you travel there, however, you usually won’t see any bandits. This is because they’re hidden, and only appear when they see a merchant approaching their position. To lure them out of hiding, you will need to have a trade good item on you. That said, keep in mind that carrying a trade good on your character will make it impossible to fight! Thus, we recommend traveling with a wagon with trade goods on it, and dealing with the bandits that appear as you travel through the lands. In this way, you can obtain imperial conquest golden seals.

The following items can be exchanged at NPC Valks, in Calpheon City.

Tip!Remember that bandits will also appear when you have a trade good on your mount. By using a mount, be it a horse or a wagon with several horses attached to it, one can level up training and trading, as well as obtain the golden seals from imperial conquest by defeating the bandits that appear on the road, and imperial training by leveling up a horse and selling it.

Adventurers can sell horses that are level 15 or above to the imperial court through imperial horse delivery, and in exchange acquire silver and golden seals. In particular, Adventurers tend to sell low tier horses, or horses with undesirable skills, via this form of imperial delivery, as other, finer horses tend to be more valuable and sell for a higher price in the horse market.

The amount of imperial training golden seals you obtain for selling horses depends on the horse tier. For example, you will get 1 seal for trading a tier 1 horse, but the higher tier a horse is.

Additionally, by selling horses this way you will also obtain other valuable items, such as flowers of oblivion employed to craft items used in the awakening process of a mythical horse.

What many Adventurers do, and we recommend trying at least once, is obtain a wagon, attach several low level horses to it, and travel throughout the world of Black Desert with the wagon. This is because all horses attached to the wagon will obtain training experience. This way, you can level up several horses at the same time, instead of just one by one.

Lastly, you can also exchange x5 or x15 of these seals with any stable keeper in the territory of Valencia to obtain the two types of camels currently available.

➤ You can read more about the life skill in the [Training] page.

You can obtain these golden seals by selling blue grade fish or higher to the various Imperial Fishing Delivery NPCs found throughout the land. Imperial fishing delivery managers can only purchase up to a given amount per each type of fish per event cycle, and you have to compete with other Adventurers selling fish to the same NPC. However, if you are successful, you can sell your fish to the Imperial Fishing Delivery NPC for 250% of its normal market price.

Unless you need the fish for another purpose, we recommend that you sell your catch to the Imperial Fishing Delivery NPCs for a higher profit.

You can learn these golden seals by supervising workers. You’ll obtain them at a fixed chance when your workers return from each work cycle. As a result, you’ll acquire these seals at a much faster rate the more workers you assign to a task, such as collecting resources from the world.

These seals are obtained automatically, and are kept at the storage of the town the worker resides in. They’re mostly used to obtain better workers.

Subtópico: Farming
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
This life skill consists of renting fences and installing them in the area you want, creating gardens. This will allow you to plant seeds inside and harvest what you’ve grown. What’s more, you can obtain better quality seeds through plant breeding and replant them, obtaining better results, or for example you can obtain haystacks to raise cows and produce milk.

In order to maintain your own garden, you need to prepare.It’s not hard. Let’s begin with this step-by-step guide below.


To run a garden, the most important thing you’ll need to prepare is contribution points.Since fences are an absolute necessity for this life skill, they aren’t items that can be purchased, and instead need to be rented through NPCs. These tend to be farm owners, material vendors, and Old Moon Guild managers.

There are different types of fences, and each costs a different amount of contribution points. As with all items obtained with contribution points, fences can be returned to get the contribution points back.

➤ You can read more about contribution points in the [Contribution] page.

The following table shows the different types of fences available, and how to obtain them.

◆ What is the difference between a strong fence and an Old Moon fence?
The more plants one can put in a fenced garden, the larger this one is, and thus the more space it takes.You can have a maximum of 10 fenced gardens, and it is suggested to have all of them together in the same area. Due to this, you might find yourself without the necessary space to install all your fences together, one next to the other.That’s where the Old Moon fences come into play. They cost the same as a strong fence, allow you to have the same number of plants in them, and take much less space than a strong fence.
However, keep in mind that while you can rent an Old Moon fence at any point, you won’t be able to install and use them until your character has reached farming master 1.

After you rent fences, you can install them in non-safe zone areas. These make up most of the world of Black Desert.

In order to install a fence, right-click the fence in your character’s inventory. This will take you to the Place Mode view. There, you can place fences in the location you want with your cursor.Avoid obstacles like rocks and trees when you install a fence. Additionally, it is more convenient to place fences close to an area you visit frequently to speed up harvesting.



In the Place Mode view, you can place fences only in areas where the (install) box pops up in green.

When you have completed installing a fence, move within the borders of the fence that you just placed and press the R key to start managing your garden.



If you have your garden ready, the next step is to plant seeds.

You can obtain seeds gathering from bushes and plants, buy them from an NPC, or receive them as quest rewards. Haystacks can be obtained by drying x50 weeds.

You can mainly plant / install seeds, hyphae, and haystacks in your gardens.


Planting seeds is similar to installing furniture in a house. At the top left corner of the screen, you will see the available slots for planting. Select a seed from the window to the right and then click the area of the garden you want it planted in.

Note that there is a limited total number of slots when you plant seeds in a garden. These depend on the type of fence you have, as detailed in the previous section.Each seed type’s item description will let you know how many slots they take up. You’ll need to take this into account when you are planting.



As seen in the picture above, haystacks take up 4 slots.

When you are done planting a seed, the plant / hypha / haystack will display with 0% growth. It will grow nicely as time goes by.



If you’re done planting, now it’s time to manage your crops.Crops are sensitive to humidity and temperature. They are also vulnerable to attacks from pests, blights, and birds.You will periodically need to prune your crops, and make sure that they have enough water.Using fertilizer will speed up the growth rate as well.

Pest blights and the need for pruning your crops will appear randomly with a fixed chance.If you run into these problems, the crop’s growth rate drops significantly, so you need to make sure to resolve these issues quickly or the crop will suffer from halted growth.

Pruning and killing insects will reward farming EXP.Additionally, you may randomly obtain valuable items such as black crystal shards.


If the yellow growth bar turns red, it indicates there is a problem with the plant, such as a pest infection caused by blight, or entangled branches.

In these cases, approach the crop, and interact with it (hotkey: R) to prune or kill the insects in it. These actions consume 1 energy.


Tip!

For your convenience, here are some gadgets that you can install in your garden to protect your crops.

First, a scarecrow will keep attacking birds away. This means crops will grow quicker.

After that, an irrigation system. As mentioned before, you need to feed enough water to your crops to boost their growth rate. If you install an irrigation system, you won’t have to worry as much about a possible water shortage.

In order to obtain these installable objects, you need to purchase a town house and set it as a carpentry workshop. After this, send a worker to craft the item in the workshop.





The crop on the left has no scarecrow and no irrigation system. It can’t protect against birds, and also has low water absorption.Meanwhile, the crop on the right is protected from birds and has a stable water absorption rate.
There are a couple of activities you can do yourself to help the crop you’ve planted grow.

There are a couple of activities you can do yourself to help the crop you’ve planted grow.
If the crop needs water and it hasn’t rained lately, get some distilled water (or purified water) ready in your inventory and take it to your garden. You can right-click on the item and the crop will be watered.You can also use fertilizer in the same way in order to boost the growth rate.

In order to obtain distilled water, purchase an empty bottle from any Material Vendor NPC and go to the nearest river to fill it, which will result in a bottle of river water. After this, bring up the Processing window (hotkey: L) and heat it up, which will give you distilled water.Similar to that, you can instead filter the bottle of river water to obtain purified water. While the filtering process is dependent on the weather, it can net you additional items such as alluvial gold.

The simplest fertilizer, inorganic fertilizer, can be obtained through drying grains such as wheat or barley. This is also done in the Processing window, via the drying option.Better types of fertilizer can be obtained by processing inorganic fertilizer further. Shaking it with leavening agent will result in byproduct fertilizer, and shaking this with any source of water (distilled water for example) will result in the best type of fertilizer: organic fertilizer.



Lastly, if you find all these methods too burdensome (having to water the crops, fertilize the soil, ward off bird attacks, prune the plants, and fight off blights), you can send a worker to do the work for you, or just leave the garden unattended and hope for the best.

If you send a worker, they’ll have trouble taking care of the moisture level or bird attacks, but will take care of pruning and killing insects, which will help you conveniently run your garden and have a more consistent growth rate on all your plants.

Leaving the garden unattended means leaving your crops to be eaten by birds or insects.If unattended, your crops will take longer to grow to 100%, but it also means that you can do other things in the meantime.
You can choose your strategy according to your own preferences.



Click the Garden icon on the top left part of the screen, below your health bar to view the list of gardens you have installed. Then click the Worker icon to send a worker to your garden.

You require a single worker for each fenced garden you install, and when you start out it may be difficult to assign them to this task due to a lack of enough workers, or contribution points for their lodging. Thus, we recommend you take care of your gardens yourself as you begin your adventure, and then assign workers to take care of them for you once you’ve established your own place in the world of Black Desert.

➤ You can read more about how to obtain and manage workers in the [Workers] page.

The My Gardens window will help you keep track of the status of your installed fences. It will show you the territory each fence is in, as well as let you create a path to their location. It will also tell you the type of fence, the type of crop you have in it, if a worker is currently assigned to it, and additionally it will also warn you with a yellow and red icon when the Scheduled Removal Time reaches 7 days and 2 days, respectively.



Regardless of how you manage your crops, when their growth reaches 100% you will be able to harvest them.

Although the growth value goes up to 200%, you can harvest your crop at any point after 100% with no losses.

Crop harvesting is divided into general harvesting and plant breeding.The first allows you to reap the ‘fruits’ from your crops. A potato or citron from a plant, mushrooms from a hypha, or meat and milk from haystacks.The second allows you to try breeding your seeds to obtain a higher quality version of them.

Once you succeed in plant breeding, you can obtain from a single seed of the same quality, to several seeds of a better quality.There are no penalties for attempting plant breeding at any % above 100%.




On the left, with general harvesting you can obtain, for example, onions. On the right, with plant breeding you can obtain the same or better quality seeds of the crop you planted.
When you harvest your crops, you may obtain blush leaves. This is one of the items that are considered to be byproducts from life skill activities. You can exchange them for other useful items at the designated NPC.




If you don’t use a fence for 2 weeks after installing it, it will be demolished automatically.Planting new crops in the fence will renew the timer for its demolition back to 2 weeks.

When demolished, please note that any crops that are not harvested will be removed as well. This means the crops will be deleted, and cannot be recovered.

Demolished fences will be sent to the town storage in the nearest town available.

You can demolish the fence yourself if there are no crops in the garden. The fence you demolish this way is sent to your character’s inventory. This way you can take the fence with you and install it wherever else you want, or return it to the NPC you rented it from.

Mysterious seeds can be obtained with a low chance through plant breeding.

If you process a mysterious seed and special or magical crop seeds together through shaking, you can obtain mysterious crop seeds, which can yield more crops when harvested.

Mysterious crop seeds will take up 5 times the normal amount of slots needed when planting in a garden. However the yield is that much greater, so it has the same effect as planting many crops. However, keep in mind that plant breeding will not result in further mysterious crop seeds. As such, mysterious seeds are not a renewable resource, but one time use only.



Since it takes up more slots in your garden, it can reduce the time you have to spend on maintaining your garden.

When breeding mysterious crop seeds, you can gain a sizable amount of fruits with a fixed chance. If you’re looking for ingredients needed in alchemy, it can be a good option to use the mysterious seeds you obtain.


Magical seeds are precious seeds only obtainable by those that are at farming level of artisan 1 or higher.

If you have reached this level and do crop breeding to improve the quality of seeds you have, you can obtain its magical variant. Similar to mysterious seeds, magical seeds take up 5 times the normal slots required in your garden, meaning that harvesting magical seed crops is equivalent to planting 5 normal seeds.


At first glance, it will be hard to tell the difference between mysterious and magical seeds. A quick way to differentiate them is by their icon. Mysterious seeds portray a glowing aura around the seed that magical seed icons lack.

Mysterious seeds can only be obtained with a low chance randomly by breeding, so it is hard to sustain long cycles of farming with only them.On the other hand, 1 or more magical seeds can be obtained by breeding with a fixed chance, so they’re self-sustainable.

Another notable difference between them is that, while breeding mysterious seeds will guarantee you fruits needed for alchemy, breeding magical seeds will only give you the fruits randomly at a certain chance. Thus, there are pros and cons to harvesting and breeding either type of seed.

If you’ve reached the artisan 1 level of farming and want to take less time planting, harvesting, and breeding, then we recommend the use of magical seeds. Conversely, if you haven’t reached this life skill level or if you need alchemy ingredients, then employ mysterious seeds as much as you can.


◈ Special to Magical
If you’re in need of magical seeds, you can try shaking x1 special seed, x2 mysterious seeds, and x10 purified water together. This will result in a magical seed, and the same applies for hyphas.





If you have reached the master 1 farming level, it will become even easier to farm by making use of a convenient new fence that has been introduced earlier in this page.

You can talk to the Old Moon Manager NPC in each major town and rent an Old Moon fence with contribution points. Like the strong fence, the Old Moon fence allows 10 slots for your crops. However, its size is much smaller, so installing it and maintaining your garden is more convenient.

To rent an Old Moon fence, you will need 10 contribution points.Since it still counts towards your fence rental limit, if you’re already using 10 strong fences, you must return them before you can rent any Old Moon fence.



You can talk to the Old Moon managers in each town to rent this type of fence. If you don’t know the location of any of these NPCs, please search it by using the Find the NPC feature, the looking glass icon you can find to the left of your minimap.



The Old Moon fence is only about half the size of the strong fence, but allows you to plant the same amount of crops!


One can accept farming-related quests from a variety of NPCs in the world of Black Desert.For example, Liana, located in all major towns, will offer you the quest [Farming] Know Anything About Farming? once you’ve reached Lv. 20. This questline will teach you the basics of farming and reward you with a nice, one-of-a-kind, fence.

Starting at farming level beginner 10, you can do leap quests. It requires some time and effort to complete these quests, but for rewards, you can obtain contribution EXP, farming EXP, as well as rare items like hard & sharp black crystal shards.

Once you’re at this farming level, summon the Black Spirit and check its guide menu, where you can find the available leap quests for all life skills. You can be guided to the NPC you can receive the quests from more easily by simply pressing them from the list.

Subtópico: Workers
Conteúdo do Subtópico:

Workers are NPCs that do certain types of work for your family of characters.In order to hire a worker, you need to speak with a Work Supervisor NPC. They can be found in all cities, and certain towns.

To view the workers available for hire in a given town, you will need to spend energy to view the Worker of the Day window via the Contract Workers option.
When you’re hiring workers, you need to have a certain amount of silver. The amount required will depend on the grade of the worker. You can’t hire a worker if you don’t have enough silver.

On top of that, remember that you’ll need to have enough energy to cycle through the different available workers for hire until one of your preference shows up.

There are also certain worker NPCs you will be able to find throughout the world who, upon establishing a friendly relation with you, will offer you their services. The workers you can hire this way are limited to be of yellow grade, and their race, stats, and talents are fixed.

You can fire a worker by accessing the Worker List window. You can find this window by opening the World Map screen (hotkey: M) and clicking on the icon in the lower right portion of the screen.
You can also open this window from the main menu (hotkey: Esc) → Life → Worker List.

We recommend all Adventurers to assign the Worker List window to a hotkey. This can be done through the main menu → Settings → Interface Settings → UI Hotkeys. Scroll down until you find the Worker List option, and assign an unused hotkey to it. After this, apply and confirm the changes, and you’ll be able to open the Worker List window in most situations.

Once you’re in this window, check the worker you want to fire, and press the icon showing a person’s shape with an X. A warning window will appear indicating what exact worker you’re attempting to fire.

There are different types of workers one can find throughout Black Desert’s world, depending on the town and society you’re hiring them from: goblins, humans, giants, papus, faduses, dwarves, and more.

Goblin workers have the fastest working speed and movement speed, so they get the job done quickly compared to other workers. However, they can’t repeat the work task many times because their stamina is quite low.

Giant workers have high stamina so they can repeat the work assigned to them many times, but they are slow. They can also carry an increased amount of harvested items from a production node thanks to their Production Increase talent.

Human workers have balanced stats between giants and goblins.They work and move at a moderate speed, and their stamina is higher than goblins’ but lower than that of giants.

Regarding the workers one can obtain in Kamasylvia, papus are similar to goblins, while faduses can be said to be overall similar to human workers, but possessing the same talent that giants have. The dwarves you can hire in O’dyllita are, like papus, similar to goblins.

In the Land of the Morning Light, you can hire dokkebi, dolswe, and shellfolk workers. They’re equivalent to goblin, human, and giant workers, from fastest to slowest, and from less to more stamina.Additionally, dokkebi workers can not only work at production nodes but craft special items through the dokkebi-exclusive tool workshops, the “Dokkebi Jar.” Certain nodes in the territory are also exclusive to dokkebi workers


These different types of workers are categorized into five different levels depending on their statistics and quality.Naive workers are the lowest grade, white, and they have the lowest stats. The only workers you can find of this grade are giants.Workers without any title are green grade, and their stats are a little bit better than white grade workers. Above these you can find skilled, blue grade workers.After them come the yellow grade professional workers, with stats much higher.Finally, above even professional workers you can find artisan orange grade workers, who have the highest stats of all.

In the longer term, it is recommended you find a good amount of professional and artisan workers.
To raise your amity with these worker NPCs, you will need to converse with them.

➤ You can read more about energy and amity in the [Energy] and [Amity] pages.

You can repeat the work task 50,000 times, but as workers have a limited amount of stamina, you’ll have to restore their stamina from time to time.

➤ You can read more about investing in nodes in the [Node] and [Contribution] pages.

When you assign a work task to a worker, their stamina will be spent. You can’t order them to work when their stamina is depleted.Once this happens, you need to press the Recover button in the Worker List window, next to their name, or the big Recover All button in the lower part of the window.After this, a small window will appear in which you can select the food you want to give them.You need certain types of food items, such as beer or grilled bird meat, in order to restore a worker’s stamina.
The automatic recovery feature prioritizes the workers' stamina when it reaches 3 and by the sorting order of recovery items within the family inventory.A notification will display when there are no worker recovery items in your Family Inventory.

➤ You can read more about the family inventory in the [Family Inventory] page.
Second, you can assign workers to town workshops.In order to send workers to a production node, you need to invest in it. On the other hand, in order to send workers to a task in a house, this one must be acquired and then set as a workshop.

In order for the worker to be able to craft, the necessary materials need to be in the town’s storage where the worker is located at, rather than where the workshop is located.
Keep in mind that you need to have enough materials in the storage of the town where the worker is from. Otherwise, they won’t be able to work on crafting your desired items.

➤ You can read more about crafting in town workshops in the [Crafting] page.

Every time a worker’s level goes up by 10, they get a chance to take a promotion test. This test goes on for 8 hours, and only one worker can take it at a time. If they pass the test, their grade will improve. For example, a skilled worker will become a professional worker.

The success rates for workers to pass promotion tests depend on their grade, regardless of level, and are the following.
Promotion
Normal → Skilled
90%
Skilled → Professional
70%
Professional → Artisan
50%

If a worker passes a promotion test and becomes a higher grade worker, it will go back to level 1. As such, they will know only 1 skill at this point, and they will learn new skills when they level up.The skills of yellow grade workers that you hire by befriending them are already set, so you should check which worker has the skills you need.



When normal workers reach Lv. 30, you can spend 20% of their EXP to change one of the skills that they have. The skills they learn will be decided at random, and you can try changing their skills again every time they have enough EXP from this point onward, even if they continue to level up on their way to Lv. 40.

It may be tedious if you’re unlucky, but eventually you’ll have the perfect workers for the task at hand.




You can use the Worker Exchange function through the Worker Supervisor NPC.You can register a worker who is on standby for sale, or hire other Adventurers’ workers.Their basic silver cost is different depending on their grade, and it goes up with the worker’s acquired levels and skills.

When you hire a worker from the Worker Exchange window, you need to check what kind of skills the worker has and which town they are affiliated with.When you hire a worker below artisan grade, you also need to check how many promotion tests they can take in the future.

It is useful to check this function from time to time in case you need a worker with a specific skill, or of a better grade than the ones you currently have in a given town.

Please note that certain workers, like those from the forests of Kamasylvia, cannot be exchanged.

Subtópico: Sailing & Bartering
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
Sailing on the open seas is a magical experience that offers a mix of peace, adventure, and discovery. The vast ocean provides a chance to enjoy nature's maritime beauty, as well as meet the people that call the islands scattered around their home.

The feeling of accomplishment from successfully navigating the sea and mastering new skills, such as sea monster hunting and bartering, can be said to be equivalent to discovering a new territory, or defeating a powerful boss you had never seen before. Whether you're a seasoned sailor or a beginner, the wonders of sailing on the open seas await your discovery.


You may have seen ships anchored and traveling around the different port towns, such as in Velia or Port Epheria, during your journey. If you’ve ever wondered what the ocean content of Black Desert’s world offers, you too will need to delve into the art of sailing, and for that you will require a sea-worthy ship.

While you can obtain rafts, rowboats, fishing boats, and cogs quite easily, it is recommended that you obtain at the very least a Bartali sailboat, or better an Epheria sailboat or frigate, when you start your journey at sea. A Bartali sailboat can be purchased from Proix, in Velia. An Epheria sailboat or frigate can be crafted, upgraded into, or purchased from the Central Market. You can also obtain them by exchanging Shakatu seals.

When you obtain a sailboat or frigate you will see that they’re quite slow and offer little in the way of inventory slots and weight capacity, not to mention the visual difference between them and the majestic ships you might notice anchored at the different towns’ wharfs. Black Desert offers a ship upgrading path you can follow to ultimately obtain those same marvelous ships.

➤ You can read more about this topic in the [Ship Upgrading] page. Please note that many of the basics of features mentioned there are explained here in the Sailing & Bartering page.

The top bar indicates the speed of the ship. Below you’re given the option to toggle the continuous use of the skill Breezy Sail (from sailing level skilled 1 onward). Please be careful when enabling this option, as it consumes rations like when you manually use it.

Below that, you can find the durability (in red) and rations (in yellow) bars. The ship’s durability is its health. If it reaches zero, the ship is destroyed. The ship’s rations are consumed when moving, when using skills, and when doing certain activities. When they reach zero all skills that require them won’t be usable, and the ship will move at a considerably slower speed than normal.

To the right, you will see the wind information. It will tell you how strong the wind is and in which direction it goes. Going against the wind with your ship’s sails unfolded will slow your ship’s movement. However, going in the direction of the wind with the ship’s sails unfolded will increase its movement speed at a rate relative to the strength of the wind.

The cannon icons on both sides show you information on the firing cooldown and the number of cannonballs you have left.



◈ Anchor
While on a ship, the Anchor UI will be activated whenever you approach a Papu or Otter Barterer NPC around the islands of the Great Ocean.



Note that you must be holding onto the steering wheel of the ship in order for the Anchor UI to appear.

It offers the following options:

- Anchor: Activates features available on islands and other specific locations such as certain shipwrecked ships out in Margoria.
- Explore / Supply: Sends sailor(s) to islands to explore or get supplies. You can supply the rations you have loaded on your ship with Supply and find treasures with Explore. In order to use Explore or Supply, you need to have at least 100,000 rations loaded on your ship. Once you begin exploring or supplying at any island, you can restart them only after 20 minutes.
- Barter: You can engage in bartering activities with a nearby Barterer NPC.

Please note that the ship will stop if you press the Anchor button, and it will not move until you press the Depart button.



◈ Board & Disembark
Any Adventurer atop a ship can see the Board and Disembark buttons appear on their screen. Pressing the Disembark button will instantly teleport them to land, as long as there's a wharf manager nearby. Note that, if you're on the wheel, you will need to press the Disembark button once to take you off the wheel, and press it again to move to the wharf manager. This function has a 5-second cooldown, and it can be set to a hotkey via Settings → Interface Settings → UI Hotkeys.

Like with the disembark function, remember that you can likewise instantly teleport to your nearby ship from shore by left-clicking the ship’s icon (anchor-shaped) beneath your character’s HP bar, or by pressing the Board button that appears above the Disembark one. Pressing the Board button again while aboard your ship will take you to the ship's wheel.




◈ Sailors
You will find various kinds of sailors around Velia, Port Epheria, and Iliya Island. If you have a sailor contract certificate item on you, you can hire them.These certificates can be purchased for 3,000,000 silver from Philaberto Falasi at Port Epheria, and Islin Bartali at Velia's Lunar Halo Inn and Proix at the Dancing Marlin Tavern, both in Velia.

The health of sailors, called their condition, can be recovered by offering them chowder and raisin bread.- Chowder can be obtained via cooking with a cooking utensil at a residence with the following ingredients: Dried Pearl Oyster Flesh x1, Pepper x2, Pork x2, Milk x1, Teff Bread x1.- Raisin Bread can be purchased from Islin Bartali in Velia, and from the different wharf managers.

If ill, a sailor can be cured with an elixir of regeneration.This elixir can be obtained through simple alchemy (hotkey: L) with the following materials: Mandragora Essence x1, Essence of Magic Power x1, Oil of Regeneration x1, Troll Blood x2, Grape x4.



You can check the status of the sailors assigned to your ship in the Sailor Info tab of the Ship Info window, opened automatically when accessing your character’s profile while steering a ship (hotkey: P).

To cure an ill sailor or recover its condition, check in your ship in a wharf, and then select the Manage Sailors option.



After this, select the sailor you want to help and offer them the necessary items.



Once they’re recovered, the Board option in the bottom right side of the window will be enabled, allowing you to attach the sailors once more to your ship.

If you ask yourself how many sailors you can have at any moment in your ship, it depends on the capacity of the ship, your maximum number of sailors, and how many cabins each sailor occupies. For example, an Epheria sailboat only has 10 cabins, while an Epheria carrack has 100. Using the example above, sailor Arkahn may only use 3 cabins when assigned to a ship, but his stats are worse than sailor Icaron who uses 10 cabins.

To increase the maximum number of sailors you can have, you will need the item Sailor's Oath. These oaths are obtained from quest rewards during Oquilla's Eye’s questline [The Great Expedition] First Sailboat into Oquilla’s Eye and from the quest Chulong's Gift, unlocked after doing the previous questline, in Nampo’s Moodle Village at the other side of the ocean. You can check it in the Suggested tab of the Quests window (hotkey: O). Please make sure to not delete these before using them, as they cannot be obtained again.



Sailors receive EXP and grow from defeating sea monsters and doing regular and special barters.

EXP received is increased depending on the number of sailors on board your ship.

1 sailor: 100% EXP2–3 sailors: 120% EXP4–5 sailors: 140% EXP6–7 sailors: 160% EXP8–10 sailors: 180% EXP

For example, you will receive 60% x 2 = 120% EXP if you have 2 sailors on board.



◈ Emergency Ration Supply
If you find yourself with low rations in the middle of the high seas, don't worry. You can supply food you have in your inventory to the ship as emergency rations.Foods of different quality restore different amounts of rations:

- White Grade: 80- Green Grade: 100- Blue Grade: 240- Yellow Grade: 4000- Orange Grade: 22000

Note that food items used to restore stamina of land workers and those that cannot be registered on the Central Market cannot be used as emergency rations.



◈ Ship Skills
Starting with improved Epheria sailboats and frigates, a large variety of skills can be used when sailing with your ship. These skills are unlocked the higher your character’s sailing life skill level is.

The following are the skills you can use on a ship, and the key commands required for activating them.



Some, like Ram, Focus Fire, Volley, or Bull’s-Eye improve your naval combat capabilities, while the rest offer you greater maneuverability.



The trading of the sea, while bartering you'll be exchanging specific items for other items at certain NPCs, called barterers, mainly around the different islands north of the continent.

Each item has a specific grade, and through the Bartering window one is able to see which item each Barterer NPC seeks in exchange for a higher grade item. You can access the Bartering window via the main menu (hotkey: Esc) → Life → Barter. You can also access it through the Load Cargo window when moving bartering items from and into your ship, via the Barter Information button, and from the Search Barter button at the bottom right part of the World Map screen (hotkey: M).

Sea trade goods, also known as bartering items, are categorized into different grades, called levels. Level 1 barter goods appear in gray, level 2 in green, level 3 in blue, level 4 in yellow, and level 5 in red.A barterer on an island will, for example, ask you for [Level 1] Raft Toy x1, and in exchange will give you [Level 2] Conch Shell Ornament x2.

Barterers might give you 1 or more items during the barter exchange.You can exchange the same item as many times as it is determined in the Bartering window.
Bartering can only be done on a ship, and via any papu or otter barterer who has been sent to each island, or sailors who have drifted to Margoria. The exchange and loading will automatically take place if the necessary item(s) is in the ship. Each bartering exchange will consume parley points. These are renewed per bartering refresh cycle.

Trade items which are used for bartering can only be loaded through the Load Cargo feature from a Wharf Manager NPC. Note that you cannot barter items in your character's inventory.



Barter items will be destroyed when large ships are destroyed, or when remotely collected to a wharf.



The barter window, seen above, will give you all the necessary details about the exchange at that location. What item you have, how many you have of that item, what you will receive in return, how many exchanges are allowed, your current ship’s weight capacity, how much weight will be gained or lost when doing a single exchange, and how much parley will be consumed per barter. It also lets you exchange all the items you have at once, instead of exchanging them one by one.

The following barters can happen in island nodes in the ocean.

Level 1 Trade
Land materials → Level 1 trade goods
Level 2 Trade
Level 1 trade goods → Level 2 trade goods
Level 3 Trade
Level 2 trade goods → Level 3 trade goods
Level 4 Trade
Level 3 trade goods → Level 4 trade goods
Level 5 Trade
Level 4 trade goods → Level 5 trade goods
Final Trade
Level 5 trade goods → Crow Coin
Other Trades
Trade goods → Ship materials & enhancement materials

Some barters will offer you materials that are needed for upgrading to better ships, or ship equipment enhancement materials.

Level 5 barter goods, and occasionally level 4 ones, can be exchanged for crow coins.You can check the crow coins that you have obtained up to that point below the weight bar in your inventory (hotkey: I).



Level 3 barter goods and above can also be sold for silver. The higher the level of the trade good is, the higher the price will be.

The storage keepers from each territory became interested in bartering, and thus started to buy trade goods. You can sell Lv. 3–5 trade goods at the existing shops as well. You can only sell Lv. 5 trade goods at a town storage’s currency exchange.

Level 1 trade goods (100LT)
N/A
Level 2 trade goods (800LT)
N/A
Level 3 trade goods (900LT)
1 million silver (can be sold)
Level 4 trade goods (1000LT)
2 million silver (can be sold)
Level 5 trade goods (1000LT)
7.5 million silver (can be sold)or15 million silver (can be sold)(depends on the barter good)

The bartering item list can be reset by pressing the Barter Refresh button in the upper right of the Barter Information window. This will reset both the items offered for bartering, and the amount of parley required to barter them with.



At first, bartering will be offered to you from only a small number of islands, but as you do more bartering, you will get offerings from more papus and otters from many more islands.

When you click on a trade good from the Barter window, the window will move to the trade good that is required to obtain it.

Everyday at 06:00 UTC, your barter refresh points will be reset to 100. If you have an active value pack, you can recover 50 extra barter refresh points (i.e. Your points will be reset to 150 instead of 100).The number of barter refresh points consumed when using the Barter Refresh function depends on the number of barters you have left for that day. Using instant refresh will consume an additional 30 points.



Additionally, if you have some Lv. 1 trade goods you don’t need, you can visit Gerio and Tidio, in Beiruwa Island and Barater Island respectively, to exchange them up to four times for a Lost Trade Box. Opening this box will give you a barter trade good from Lv. 1 to Lv. 5, at random.



◈ Ship Material Barter
Due to the increasing demand for materials to upgrade ships, the Crow Merchants Guild now provides separate bartering opportunities for them, called "ship material barter."However, there will be some exceptions for certain ship upgrade materials.

You can use the Ship Material Refresh function from the Refresh Barter window twice a day. When you use the Ship Material Refresh function, there is a small chance that you will uncover all the possible barters you can make for crow coins at every island. You can use crow coins to barter any Level 2 to 5 sea trade goods when this happens.

During ship material barter, you will get materials for upgrading a ship. You may also get materials to enhance ships, as well as treasure-related items.

The accumulated number of exchanges needed to barter for the following items will drastically decrease when using ship material barter.
- Brilliant Pearl Shard- Brilliant Rock Salt Ingot

The ship materials you can obtain by doing ship material barter are as follows.

- Island Tree Coated Plywood
- Rock Salt Ingot
- Cobalt Ingot
- Cox Pirates' Artifact (Parley Beginner)
- Bright Reef Piece
- Pure Pearl Crystal
- Deep Sea Memory Filled Glue
- Cox Pirates Extermination Seal
- Tide-Dyed Standardized Timber Square
- Luminous Cobalt Ingot
- Great Ocean Dark Iron
- Seaweed Stalk
- Cox Pirates' Artifact (Parley Expert)
- Ruddy Manganese Nodule
- Enhanced Island Tree Coated Plywood
- Moon Scale Plywood
- Moon Vein Flax Fabric
- Violent Sea Monster's Scale
- Saltwater Crocodile's Scale
- Brilliant Rock Salt Ingot
- Brilliant Pearl Shard
- Cox Pirates' Artifact (Combat)
- Oquilla's Flower
- Tear of the Ocean
- Deep Tide-Dyed Standardized Timber Square



◈ Special Barter
As you proceed with bartering, you can be offered a special barter from the bartering NPCs of each island, at a low chance.Special barters are barters that randomly occur by chance while using regular bartering. Though they do not happen often, you can obtain a very expensive item or a large number of crow coins through these special barters. You can get either crow coins or expensive goods you can't get from a regular barter by using gold bars at a special barter.The more you barter, the more chance a special barter may occur.



You will see the items you can exchange through special barter only when you have reached the relevant island. The islands where special barters can be carried out are displayed with a gold badge icon in the World Map (hotkey: M)'s Barter Information UI.You can see the information about the areas where Special Barters are available in the Barter Information window.



Whenever a special barter is made available, a system message will be displayed.

Once you're on an island with a special barter available, you can select either the Normal Barter or Special Barter options from the Bartering window.

Please note that the item information does not change every 4 hours for special barter opportunities. If you do not make the exchange when special barter is available, it will no longer appear.



Crow’s Nest is the island covered in fog managed by the Crow Merchants Guild, located north of Tinberra Island. Many at sea, both wealthy and unfortunate alike, search for its location for one or another reason.

There, you can purchase items such as Khan's Concentrated Magic and other ocean-related goods such as equipment for a carrack, ship upgrade materials, or ship equipment enhancement materials.

Please note that for most of the items offered by Ravinia to be purchased with crow coins, their cost in crow coins is a lot higher than it is to obtain the item directly by yourself. As such, it is better to purchase items from Ravinia only when you need a few of a single type, in case of needing ship upgrade materials for example. Other items you will require, however, will need to be purchased from Ravinia. It is recommended to save your crow coins for when you’re at that point in time.


◈ Rebinia’s Shop
On Lema Island you will encounter Rebinia, Ravinia's twin sister, who has opened up a crow coin shop there and sells useful common items, as well as rare Manos accessories.

You can purchase the following items from Rebinia's shop. Remember that you can only purchase the special, limited boxes containing the items below from Rebinia on Lema Island.








It can be obtained in two ways:
– When a special barter appears during barter, there is a low chance for the item “Epheria's Star” to be obtainable.
– The guild victorious in a conquest war in the territories of Calpheon, Mediah, and Valencia is rewarded the item “Epheria’s Star.”

Please note you will find it in the guild’s storage. Only the guild master can move Epheria's star from the guild storage, and award a deserving guild member via the Present button found at the bottom of the guild’s storage window.



With this item in your inventory, you can accept a special quest from Philaberto Falasi in Port Epheria. Complete this quest to obtain the ship license for an Epheria galleon, and the Captain Epheria title, which is a temporary title that lasts for 7 days.
You can only ride and control an Epheria galleon for the duration of the title Epheria Captain, and you can only access other features if you do not have the title or if it has expired.



Please note that the fire rate and max range of an Epheria galleon's cannons is identical to an Epheria carrack's cannons, that Epheria galleons cannot equip ship equipment, and that the cost of repairs for an Epheria galleon is 10 million silver per 10% of damage. (Damage increases upon remote collection or ship destruction)
Like with Epheria carracks, Epheria galleons need to be supplied upon initial registration.






However, as the vessel is made with considerably high technological expertise relative to its era, the construction process is not an easy task. It requires significant assistance from the people of Moodle Village, thus it is crucial to maintain strong relations with them through activities such as eliminating the Goldmont Pirates that threaten the village, exchanging currencies or crow coins, and more.

Subtópico: Crafting
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
The materials that you obtain through gathering and processing can be used in town workshops and workbenches to craft new items.

There is a great variety of items you can craft: weapons, armor, reform stones, decorations, clothes, wagons, ships, and even trade good items. Thus, it is a good idea to learn how to craft.

There are two types of crafting.– General crafting, which completes an item with a single work task.– Large scale crafting, which requires multiple work tasks.

With general crafting you can craft gathering tools, equipment pieces, and other similar items.
With large scale crafting you can craft ship licenses and wagon registrations.



Crafting in Black Desert is different from any other game. Instead of crafting the items yourself, you hire workers to craft them for you. It might feel awkward at first, but it gets more interesting as you go along.


Materials are the basic elements needed to craft items. They can be obtained through gathering or processing, or can often be purchased from other Adventurers via the Central Market.

If you want to know what materials are required to craft an item, press the F2 key on your keyboard while inside the game. It will bring up the Adventurer’s Board. On the top right corner of the window you will find the Crafting Notes button. There, you can search for items and materials.

Please note that If an item is not registered on the Crafting Notes window, you can find what materials it needs at a workshop / workbench where you craft that item.



➤ You can read more about this function in the [Crafting Notes] page.


◈ Contribution Points
In order to craft items, you need crafting facilities such as workshops or workbenches.To obtain these, you need contribution points.You can earn EXP to obtain these points by finishing most quests available in the game.



You will also need contribution points to obtain houses for your workers’ lodgings, as well as for investment in production nodes from where to collect resources required for crafting.

➤ You can read more about this feature in the [Contribution] page.


◈ Workers
Crafting in Black Desert is done not by your own character, but by sending a worker to a workshop or a workbench.

You can contract workers through the work supervisors in each town or city.You can get one worker for each town by default. For more workers, you will need to obtain lodging for them. For this, you need to repurpose a purchased house as lodging.



➤ You can read more about these features in the [Workers] and [Houses] pages.



In order to craft a simple item you need to obtain certain materials. To obtain these yourself, you need gathering tools.Basic gathering tools are sold by material vendors. However, you can make better quality tools with higher durability and reduced gathering time yourself, allowing you to gather more.

Let’s learn about general crafting by crafting a gathering tool, a lumbering axe.


◈ Purchasing a Tool Workshop
You need a tool workshop in order to craft gathering tools.First, click on Velia in the World Map screen (hotkey: M).Then, use the search tab on the right top corner of the screen to locate a tool workshop.



A blue arrow will mark the locations of houses of the searched type.When you click on the house marked by the arrow, it will display a menu with the house’s information. Select the Tool Workshop option and then press Purchase: Tool Workshop.

To purchase a house, you need contribution points and silver. Additionally, some houses require previous ones to be purchased. So, if you want to buy 3-2, you may need to buy 3-1 first.

The invested contribution points work as a deposit. You can get them back when you return the house.




◈ Preparing the Materials
After changing the use of a house to a tool workshop, click on the Manage Crafting button to reveal a list of craftable items on the left.



If the items are displayed in gray, it is because you do not have enough materials in the storage of the worker you’re selecting to carry out the crafting task.

In order to make a lumbering axe, you need ash timber x1 and copper ingot x3.As mentioned earlier, crafting in Black Desert is done by workers. So you’ll need to keep the materials in the town/city storage of the worker you’re tasking to carry out the crafting, and not in your inventory or the town’s storage (unless the worker is from there).

• Ash Timber: You can obtain it by cutting down ash trees around Velia with a lumbering axe.
• Copper Ore: You can obtain it by mining copper at the Coastal Cave with a pickaxe.• Melted Copper Shard: You can get melted copper shard x1 by heating copper ore x5.• Copper Ingot: You can get copper ingot x1 by heating melted copper shard x10.

Please note that processing results may vary depending on the processing level of your character, and that you may require certain processing certificates to obtain ingots. You can find more information about these certificates in the [Processing] page.

While crafting materials such as these can be easily obtained by gathering and processing, you can also buy them from the Central Market.

Once you have prepared all the materials, go to Ernill, the storage keeper in Velia, and place all the materials into your storage.

This guide will use workers in Velia, so we shall store materials in Velia’s storage. If you want to use a worker from another town, you must keep the materials at that town’s storage.


◈ Hired Workers
Now that you have the workshop and the materials in place, you just need a worker to make the lumbering axe.Go to Santo Manzi, the work supervisor of Velia, and hire a worker. You need 5 energy to look for a worker, and you’ll need a small amount of silver to hire them, as well as enough lodging space.

If you don’t have enough space for workers, you can get a worker’s lodging. You can obtain them the same way you purchased the workshop. Once you have more lodging, you can hire more workers.




◈ Time to Craft
When the tool workshop, the materials, and the worker are all prepared, you will be able to select the product to be made on the list of items in the workshop.



Crafting will begin once you set how many times you want the worker to craft the item, and the time it will take for each craft can be seen on the Estimated Work Time section of the window.

Press the Change button to set the number of times you want to craft that item, and click confirm.Please note that the maximum number of times a worker can be set up to carry out a task is 50,000. The worker will automatically stop working when the work is finished, does not have enough crafting materials, or its stamina is depleted.

The crafting materials in the storage will disappear the moment the crafting task begins. Be careful, because even if you cancel the work in the middle of the process, or even a second after pressing the Start Work button, you cannot get back the materials.

When crafting finishes, you can find the completed product in the town’s storage.





The main difference between general crafting and large scale crafting is that you will need to carry out several work tasks to complete a product with large scale crafting, while a single work task will suffice when crafting an item via general crafting.

As an example of large scale crafting, let’s craft a ship license.


◈ Purchase a Shipyard
In order to craft a ship license, you need a shipyard.Just like the tool workshop, you can click Velia on the World Map screen, and use the search tab on the top right corner to locate a shipyard.



In this town, the shipyard is located on the second floor of 3-2, the same building as our tool workshop.


◈ Preparing the Materials
Large scale crafting tends to require a lot more materials than general crafting. When you click on the Manage Crafting button to look at the required materials, you will notice an important difference in the menu’s layout.

In the tool workshop, the Manage Crafting window shows a list of all the items that can be crafted in that workshop. For large scale crafting, the list will show only one product at a time. That’s why, when you see the list for the first time, you may not find the item you are looking for. By clicking on the arrow on the top right side of the menu, you can move to another craftable item.



Don’t want to craft a ship license for a rowboat? Press the arrow at the top right corner of the menu to look for the license to craft a raft.



When you look at the materials for the ship license: raft, it shows you need logs and black stone powder. The number on the right side of the material’s name shows the amount of work tasks that the worker has to do, and the 9/1 in the Detailed Work Information window says you need 1 of that material for a single task, and you currently have 9. As such, as your worker needs to perform 3 tasks with that item, you will need 3.

So, in order to craft this ship license, you need 25 logs and 3 units of black stone powder, and the total number of work tasks is 28, as you can see in the required work count at the top part of the window. For small large scale crafts like this one it isn’t as useful, but for really big projects it is good to know from the beginning the total amount of work tasks required.

• Log: You can get this when you cut down trees with the lumbering axe, regardless of the type of tree.
• Black Stone Powder: You can make this through the refinery in Velia 3-1, or by grinding (processing) magic crystals, such as a magic crystal of crimson flame – precision.

Prepared materials can be used for crafting once you put them in the storage of the same town your workers are from. This is important, as workers cannot be moved between towns.


◈ Hired Workers
You were only able to use one worker for general crafting earlier, but for large scale crafting you need to carry out a lot more work tasks to complete crafting the desired item. Due to this, you can use multiple workers in large scale crafting.

Go to the Work Supervisor NPC of the town, and hire more workers to finish crafting faster.If you do not have enough space for workers, as earlier, purchase more workers’ lodging to be able to hire more workers.

If the worker has skills related to large scale crafting, or has learned shipbuilding / wagon-making skills such as Mount Knowledge, they will work faster compared to other workers.


◈ Time to Craft
Now that you have a shipyard, the required materials, and a good amount of workers ready, we can now start crafting the ship license for the raft.

Choose from the list of required tasks to the left which one you want to start, and the worker you want to carry it out from the worker list to the right.After setting the number of work tasks, press the Start Work button to start crafting.

Be careful with starting a large scale craft, because you won’t be able to craft anything else there until the project has been finished.

Tip!In general crafting, you needed to have all the materials ready in order to start the crafting of the desired item. However in large scale crafting, only one of the materials needs to be ready before starting.For example, you need a total of 25 logs to finish the ship license for a raft, but a worker requires only 1 log per work task. As such, your worker can begin working even if you only have 1 log in your storage.
Since large scale crafting requires a lot of materials, you can send other workers to work on producing more materials. You can save time by starting on the large scale craft first, and producing the materials needed at the same time.

As with general crafting, if you cancel a large scale crafting project once it has begun, you will not be able to get back the materials that have already been used so far.
When you have finished all 28 work tasks, you will be able to find your ship license: raft in the town’s storage, the same way you got the lumbering axe.

You can craft so many and different items using similar processes. Among them, equipment for your characters and mounts, trade goods, furniture for your residence, enhancement & reform items, gathering tools, and even siege weapons for PvP wars.



Why don’t you also try crafting your own items?

Subtópico: Houses
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
Houses are the centerpiece of your daily life in the world of Black Desert.Not only do they serve several functions, but they are also a place to express your sense of style.

A house is considered an individual space separate from the common game areas, and it is possible for each Adventurer to each own all available houses in the world. If you have the silver and contribution points, you can have hundreds of houses. However, keep in mind that the number of houses available for residential purposes is limited.

Houses are mainly used for life skill production activities, but you can also use them for different purposes. The interior of residences can be decorated with wallpapers and furniture, and they can be a place where you can play with your pets, and spend time socializing with fellow Adventurers, friends, and guild members.You can also rest in your residence, repair your equipment, or read books.


Open the World Map screen (hotkey: M) and click on a town to view the houses available for purchase.

You can identify the houses you can buy easily because they are colored in blue.Once you buy a house, adjacent houses become available for purchase, and the list of houses available for purchase becomes larger.In simpler terms, if you want to buy a gray house instead of a blue one, you must buy adjacent houses first.

You need to spend contribution points to purchase a house. The larger and more functional the house is, the more contribution points will be needed.Therefore, you may want to check the strategic value of a house before you decide to buy it.

You can sell acquired houses at any time to retrieve the contribution points you invested, but you won’t receive the time and silver invested in improving the house and changing its functions.



➤ For more information on contribution points, please visit the [Contribution] page.



Each house has a few functions (usages) that can be set up.

You must assign a usage when you purchase a house. If you don’t select one, the house will automatically be assigned as storage.

Although you can change its usage at any time, it costs time and silver to do so, and you cannot use the house while it is being changed.

A house can be largely set as a personal residence, lodging for workers, town storage, a refinery, a workshop, a workbench or a textile mill.




◈ Residences
You can place production equipment such as tools used for alchemy and cooking, as well as various kinds of furniture, inside of your residences. You can initially set up to 5 houses as residences. This can later be expanded.

If you change the usage of a house from a residence to something else, any furniture that was in it will be automatically transferred to the town storage.

– My Residence ListClick on the Residence icon in the top left of the screen to view the list of residences you currently own. You can initially own up to 5 residences, regardless of territory.

Open your Residence List and click on the Location button to see the travel route to the residence selected.




◈ Lodgings
Your hired workers dwell in the lodgings you possess in a given town.

You can hire your first worker in any town without any acquired lodging, but you will need them if you want to hire more workers for each town.
You can send a worker to a production node to gather various materials, or to a workshop to craft various items for you.

The items your workers have gathered or crafted will be stored at the town storage. When crafting or doing any other activity in a house, workers will use the ingredients stored in the storage of the town they’re from.

➤ Please check the [Workers] and [Crafting] pages to learn more about that aspect of the game.


◈ Storage
If you set a house as storage, it increases the number of storage slots you can use in a town storage. If you upgrade the storage house level, the slot numbers will increase accordingly.

➤ Please check the [Storage] page to learn more about town storages.


◈ Refinery
With a refinery, you can craft black stone powder, a common material used as a base ingredient for most items you can craft at a workshop. Given the appropriate materials, you can also order workers to craft black stones as well.


◈ Workshop
You can send a worker to a workshop to craft an item. If you upgrade the level of the workshop, you can craft better items of a higher quality.

Some of the items you can create for each type of workshop are listed below.Other than the ones below, there are more kinds of workshops available depending on the specific town.

Workshop
Crafted Items

◈ Shipyard & Wagon Workshop
Here you can craft a wagon or a ship.Once you succeed in crafting it, you obtain a registration emblem which you can exchange for a wagon or a ship through an NPC at a wharf or stable.


◈ Horse Ranch
Horse ranches are only available in major cities and towns. A horse ranch will increase the number of mount slots at a stable. This is where you can check in mounts.



At a residence, you can place not only functional furniture such as alchemy tools and cooking utensils, but also other various decorative furniture to customize your house.

Some furniture types have special effects. A bed restores your energy when you rest in it. Bookshelves allow you to read and gain knowledge, and some handmade furniture pieces have bonus effects that you can interact with to receive buffs, while some others are just for decorating purposes.

The objects that you can put in your residence are classified by how you place them, and there are six types.

◈ Floor Decor
There are many objects you can install on the ground.A bed, a sofa, a table, a desk, a chair, a bookcase, all kinds of tools, and so on. This category encompasses most types of objects.


◈ Flooring
You can change the visual appearance of the floors of your residence.Like wallpapers, it cannot be restored when removed/replaced, and is only available as a one-time use.

Selling your residence, or changing its function, will also permanently destroy the flooring.


◈ Wall Decor
A curtain, paintings, seasonal decorations, and even hunting trophies, can be decorated on walls.


◈ Wallpaper
Wallpapers cover and decorate all parts of your residence’s walls. Like flooring items, wallpapers are one-time use items, and cannot be restored if deleted or replaced.

If you want to change to another wallpaper, delete the existing one and then install a new one. Alternatively, you can just overlay the new one on the existing one.

Selling your residence, or changing its function, will also permanently destroy the flooring.


◈ On the Table / Floor
You can place small objects on top of other, bigger objects installed on the floor.Various dishes, flowerpots, candle stands, and so on.


◈ Ceiling Decor
Certain objects, such as chandeliers, can be installed on the ceiling of a residence.



First, enter a residence you purchased by pressing R on the door.



After entering it, click on the Place Mode button at the top of the screen.



On the right part of the Place Mode screen, select the furniture you want to install, then move the mouse to the place where you want to install the furniture.

Press the [ or ] keys on the keyboard (depending on the keyboard type you possess) to rotate the furniture left or right. You can also make sure to have objects placed in the specific direction you want by changing their placement rotation angle to stick to 45 degrees.

On the right side of the Place Mode screen, there are not only the furniture items owned by you, but also the furniture pieces you can buy from the Pearl Shop. You can select the furniture you want and place it in advance, before having to purchase it.



If you found the right place to install it, press the Space key or double-click with your mouse to complete the installation.



If you install furniture that you don’t own but have to pay for, a BUY icon will appear and the item will be listed on the Cart section to the right.If you want to purchase it, check the price and click on Purchase All to complete purchasing your furniture.



Press the Esc key to exit Place Mode and you can see the furniture you’ve installed.

You may have finished installing the furniture, but what if you want to change the wallpaper and the flooring?Let’s install wallpapers and floors in your house.



Select a wallpaper in place mode, and drag it to the wall to see the covered result in advance. Press Space to complete the installation.

If your house is a two-story house, even if you select one wallpaper, it will be applied to both the 1st floor and 2nd floor, so you don’t need to buy two of them.

However, remember that wallpapers and flooring items are one-time use only. So make sure you’ve selected the wallpaper or flooring you really want before installing them, since the purchase can’t be undone.



If you install all kinds of furniture and place small objects, you can earn interior points, if you are ranked between 1st place to 15th place in points, other Adventurers can take a look around your house.



Move to a house that you want to look inside, and press the F5 key to visit it. After that, click the Enter button to have a look around the house.

If you are ranked 1st place in a town, you can make use of the local investment banks, if available.



As there are many types of furniture, there are various ways to obtain it.Generally, you can purchase furniture through a variety of NPC vendors in towns, and you can also craft it yourself at specific workshops in every town. There is also furniture in the Pearl Shop.

However, the higher-end furniture requires high amity with certain NPCs, so they’re harder to get.

Other than that, you can obtain furniture from the following methods:
◈ Furniture Dealer NPCs
You can easily find a Furniture Dealer NPC in any major town.Depending on the kind of furniture, there are art dealers, carpet dealers, candlestick vendors and so on.If you want to buy cheap but decent furniture, most of the time the NPC will require you to spend amity you’ve earned with them.


◈ Furniture Workshops
Purchase a house and set it as a furniture workshop. Then send a worker to craft furniture yourself.Hand-crafted furniture of this type can offer you several buffs.


◈ Fishing
You can fish small objects in the water that can be used as decoration in your residences, with a low chance.


◈ Stealing
You may steal furniture from some NPCs, albeit with a slim chance of success.


◈ Monster Item Drops
As you defeat monsters, you may obtain furniture from certain monsters at a very low chance. Most of the furniture obtained this way is of an unusual, unique shape, and offers buffs to aid you in combat.


◈ Quest Rewards
Some NPCs will give you furniture items as a reward for completing quests they offer.


◈ Hunting Trophies
Similar to obtaining them from monsters, several animals you can hunt will drop you with trophies you can decorate your residence with. The more rare ones can be crafted with materials obtained from hunting.


◈ Pearl Shop
You can buy several unique furniture sets in the Pearl Shop. Before doing this, make sure they cannot be obtained in the game, as certain towns may allow you to craft the same items yourself!

Subtópico: Manor
Conteúdo do Subtópico:


Compared to regular houses that can be set as personal residences and have their interior freely decorated, manors are bigger spaces, with both interior and outdoor areas, that offer a wider range of options to personalize them.

Manors are made with a huge emphasis on expanding the content of decorating one's residences. Therefore, a good chunk of the decorative content is available outside the manor itself, thus allowing one greater freedom to decorate all of the areas within the manor’s premises. Aside from this, depending on the manor, they may also have a section for all things terrace-related, which can be decorated as well.

Alongside the manors themselves, come manor-exclusive furniture to choose from. Various items such as grass and flowers to liven up your own garden, different lighting to accentuate your manor's majesty at night, a wide assortment of trees, and more.
With spaces as big as these, why not host a concert in the garden, open up a mock-dueling circle, or even expand your fields into farms?



If you move east along the Demi River that passes in front of Heidel, before you reach the Eastern Border you will find the Blue Maned Lion's Manor.

It is a place with a wide yard that can be freely decorated with sculptures, trees, flowers, and fountains, and an interior that provides a sense of openness with high ceilings.

After solving a few simple quests, you can rent it with 5 contribution points and a daily rental fee of 1,000,000 silver

◈ How to rent
After completing the main questline for Calpheon, either Looking for Adventurers or [Boss] Witch of Horrors, or the simplified questline for season characters up to the 6th chapter, you can receive the quest [Manor] Crucio Domongatt's Summon through the Black Spirit.




After completing the questline, go to the Blue Maned Lion's Manor located along the Eastern Border.



When you approach the door, you will see a button to purchase it. It costs 5 contribution points.Contribution points used will be returned to you when you return the house.



After investing the contribution points, press the R key to open the door, and you can proceed with the contract as shown below.



You can set the length of the contract from 1 day up to 365 days by tapping the gear icon next to the contract period.

The rental amount is 1,000,000 silver per day, but discounts apply for contracts of 30 days or more. If you return the manor before the expiration of the contract period, you will receive the proportional part of your silver back, minus some fees according to the remaining period.

You can check the discount on usage cost and the fee for returning the house by hovering your cursor over the question mark button to the left of the usage amount.

◈ Furniture
Once the quests to let you rent the manor are completed, many more quests will become available throughout Black Desert’s world. These reward unique furniture pieces for the manor.

Subtópico: History of Balenos
Conteúdo do Subtópico:
The world turned mad.As if possessed, the now blood-eyed people began to attack their neighbors and friends. Their strength increased, their reason abandoned, the violence spread until the entire world was engulfed in flames.Then something happened. There were those that rose above the calamity. Holding black stones up high, they saved the world. They became known as the Edana.

Once the catastrophe had been overcome, theirs were prosperous and peaceful times, though not eternal. One day, time after these figures had already passed on, the civilization they fostered vanished.

A stone chamber in the southern reaches of a land yet to be called Balenos was sealed, and its vicinity became protected by the spirits of nature.
In the land of Balenos a towering castle arose, and with it the Kingdom of Cron was born.Noir Bartali III had the reputation of being a kind and compassionate king for the common folk, and a cruel tyrant for the nobility. During his reign the opposition was purged, and the royal authority was strengthened.With the passing of the years Cron grew stronger. At the same time, the king grew old. In time, the now feeble king’s ideals started to change. The once just Noir III became afraid of death, and more importantly, obsessed with living… By any means available.

One day, an alchemist arrived from across the desert in the east. He sought an audience with the monarch, and swayed him with promises of immortality if the kingdom assisted him in summoning the alchemist’s master. Noir III was convinced and accepted the stranger’s offer.Soon, children and maidens were gathered to be sacrificed for the ritual the alchemist was preparing. All who opposed the king’s command were killed, or worse, and on the fateful day the ritual was carried out… The castle’s spires were toppled, and the entire structure shattered in an immense explosion that devastated the entire surrounding region, reducing even the kingdom’s urban center, located at the feet of the castle, to a sea of rubble. Nobody in the castle, including the monarch, was believed to have survived the incident.It is said that a giant herd of something covered Balenos on that day turned night, and the accounts gathered from the nearest surviving inhabitants diverged greatly in regards to what they saw and heard during the event. Whatever happened, the Kingdom of Cron was no more.

In the wake of the catastrophe, some of the survivors of the kingdom gathered in the coastal village of Velia, while others dispersed throughout the continent.
Death had found its way all throughout the continent, and the Kingdom of Balenos was no exception. A terrible infectious disease from the east spread like wildfire. Later called the Black Death, it rotted the flesh of its victims black, and had no known cure. Those who were infected wailed in constant agony, suffered from hallucinations, and murmured something before succumbing to the malady.While the initial wave of the illness disappeared as abruptly as it had appeared, it and its effects would linger on, only fully fading as the years went on gradually. By the end of it, roughly half of all the population in the western half of the continent had perished from the Black Death.

As a consequence of the tragedy, the higher classes of the various western countries rallied the masses and embarked on a conflict against the Kingdom of Valencia to the east, believing it to have caused the disaster that befell all.

In time, Balenos would find itself pitted against the might of Calpheon to the west, and like other neighboring nations such as Keplan and Heidel, would end up under the eagle’s control.

After a disastrous event took place in the year 277 EC, remnants from Mediah’s military, Balenos’ immediate neighbor to the east, moved in and occupied the ruined remains of Cron Castle. Not having a military force of their own, and seeing as the exiles did not move further west, the people of Balenos hoped for the best and decided to continue their simple lives, farming and fishing.

A few years later Calpheon ceased to be a monarchy, and Heidel established a guard camp in eastern Balenos to protect the land routes connecting the towns in Balenos and Serendia from the threat of the local imps to the north and the bandits from the south.
Under the Republic of Calpheon the land of Balenos was living in relative peace. Yet, dark clouds gathered above. Both the goblins and the imps were growing restless, and the group taking up residence in the castle ruins did not intend to vacate it.

One day, the personnel of the Western Guard Camp captured an injured ogre that was escaping from a nearby forest to the south. Upon investigating the creature’s origin, the soldiers found an open entrance to long-forgotten underground ruins, a stone chamber from the time of the Ancients. Soon after, an excavation effort was set up by the Grand Chamberlain of Heidel, and a famed explorer was hired to delve into the tunnels, for where there are ancient ruins, black stones are sure to follow.

As this was happening, rumors spread of a man clad in black wandering the land…

#1 Elionian Year 265
Crucio was crowned King of Heidel when he was 27 years old, and announced to Calpheon that they would not be assisting in the expedition. The priests of Calpheon were frustrated with the situation,and they feared that they would lose their influence if the expedition came to a halt. There were Elion Chapels wherever the expedition went. The priests originally planned to spread Elionism all throughout Balenos. The priests criticized Crucio’s decision, but Dahad remained silent. King Crucio carefully reviewed his options. He knew waging a war against Calpheon would be unwise, as there were many followers of Elion in the Heidel military who remained loyal to his father. After countless meetings Crucio failed to make any headway. he was unable to overcome the pressure and reluctantly agreed to the wishes of Calpheon. Dahad welcomed King Crucio’s decision, and suggested Crucio should prepare an expedition to see Valencia Castle. This took 2 years to prepare.Domongatt already knew the road to the Black Desert like the back of his hand. However, a powerful wind blew all across Mediah making it difficult to travel. Sand storms also made it difficult for the expedition to advance. The expedition hid and waited for the wind to die down, though it was a week before Mediah even became visible.

Although they heard stories from the merchants, no one realized how much Mediah had changed. Walls armed with soldiers surrounded the city and dark black smoke rose up from within. Dahad ordered the expedition to pick up the pace so there would be no delays in the distribution of supplies. As the long line of expedition soldiers marched in the Black Desert, strong winds began hindering their path, and they noticed that, quite mysteriously, there were raindrops in the wind as well. Why would there be rain in the desert?That’s when one of the soldiers saw a red flag in the distance, signifying they were near a Valencia camp. The expedition had entered the Black Desert. The Elionian priests that accompanied the expedition looked up to the sky and prayed. They built the camp despite the strong wind to confront their old enemy. Shortly after, darkness covered the land and a rainstorm came upon them. Dahad was missing when Crucio awoke from a hole in the sand. A red flag sat in tatters next to him, perhaps indicating that Valenica had taken a bigger beating than they had.

What about the expedition? Despite the significant loss, Crucio was glad to be alive. Dark clouds started to form around their position once again. Crucio and the remaining survivors hastily retreated. However, the frequent sandstorms that battered them made it difficult for them to return. In addition, the waters from the Demi River rose to abnormal levels, effectively blocking their path. A month had passed before a large river delta formed, allowing Crucio to cross the Demi River. The defeated soldiers were exhausted from the disastrous event that marked an early end to their expedition. In spite of this, the religious body of Calpheon adorned the soldiers with awards. They made claims that Calpheon secured great victory and utterly defeated Valencia. In truth, this may have been what they needed after such a disastrous event, and this did not affect Heidel Castle and Serendia much at all. However, the wetlands increased in the southern areas.Nature’s wrath had put an end to the war, something that man could not do on their own. Peace came, allowing those affected by the war to recover. After the loss of their king, Calpheon crowned the young Guy Seric as its successor.

#2 Elionian Year 275
The Heidel merchant guild traveled to Mediah, impressed with how much the city had changed 7 years after the last expedition. Domongatt read the reports from the merchants and ordered them to find out what allowed Mediah to develop so quickly. They soon discovered the significance of the black crystal.Domongatt later rushed to the wetlands upon learning that the small pebble the young Nagas held were actually black crystals. Domongatt strongly believed that the black crystal was the key to Heidel gaining political independence and free itself from years of suffering under Calpheon. However, what lay ahead of Domongatt was only misfortune.

Calpheon was looking for the black crystals as well, and when they found none in their own lands, their king Guy Seric pounced on the opportunity after learning of the black crystals found in the quarries of Keplan and Serendia.

#3 Elionian Year 276
After securing victory over Keplan, the armies of Calpheon attacked the area near the Heidel watchtower. Heidel had a powerful, well-equipped military. As evening settled, Guy Seric ordered his soldiers to attack Heidel Castle, and an unsuspected ambush made for a quick defeat for Domonogatt. Domongatt dreaded capture, but he nonetheless refused to surrender. Domongatt told the Calpheon emissary that he would rather face death than defeat from his enemy. Cliff and his soldiers established a defense line in Keplan and Armstrong led his soldiers along the Demi Stream to attack the Calpheon soldiers. In response, Guy Seric deployed his heavy cavalry to the battlefield. Both sides suffered heavy losses as the war between Calpheon and the two brave generals raged on. Calpheon knew that even if they were to secure a victory, the casualties from this battle alone would rival the total casualties the Black Death itself.

Guy Seric realized that the purpose of this war was to gain control of the black crystals. As a result, instead of surrendering, Guy Seric offered a proposal. Although it would ensure Domongatt escaped death, he was hesitant, but eventually conceded to Guy Seric's demands. Domongatt was able to return to Heidel a year after the conditions of the proposal were met. The citizens of Heidel understood the reason behind Domongatt’s decision, and Cliff and Armstrong respected Domongatt’s decision to move the camp from the main watchtower to the southern area. There were those who dismissed Domongatt as a coward, but he was unfazed by it. Instead, Domongatt was more concerned about the extraction mill constructed by Calpheon in the wetlands of Serendia. It was around this time when Domongatt starting becoming mysteriously ill.

#4 Elionian Year 281
Uneasiness settled in the western continent with the abrupt death of Guy Seric. The officials announced that Guy Seric died from terminal illness, to the suspicion of many. They thought no healthy, young man would so easily succumb to illness, especially the king. Rumors started going around that Guy Seric was actually poisoned. Regardless, Crucio saw the sudden death of Guy Seric as an opportunity. Internal strife and power struggles would weaken Calpheon’s influence. Crucio arranged a meeting with Cliff, the captain of the Western Camp, in regards to terminating the treaty. Cliff was uneasy about Crucio’s plan, stating that tensions between Calpheon could immediately escalate if this was not handled with utmost care. The high chamberlain Jordine joined their conversation as well. Cliff recommended Jordine after hearing the news about Crucio’s illness. Jordine had a good sense of judgement and helped greatly in managing internal affairs. Jordine stated that the power struggle was not for the throne, but between the Church of Elion and the merchants loyal to it. Jordine added that Heidel would not have any influence over Calpheon’s political affairs. Crucio agreed with Jordine, but he decided to listen to Cliff’s suggestion and observe the situation. The Calpheon council quickly the resolved the political tension and pushed for reforms, effectively establishing a new Calpheon that was more powerful. Jordine also became the Grand Chamberlain at 25. Jordine lost all of his family members to Calphone soldiers that pillaged his town. Due to this, he sought revenge and enlisted in the military, leading to his eventual promotion to chamberlain. He was tasked with handling all internal political affairs, and functioned closer to a prime minister. When Calpheon built an extraction mill, King Crucio demoted himself to the title of Lord in defeat, stating he failed to carry out his responsibilities as a king. This is also the reason why Cliff was demoted a rank from general to a captain. Jordine assured Crucio that the Calpheon would eventually lose its power within 5 years. He posited the power struggle between the merchant guilds will continue, and the Church of Elion will focus on increasing its religious influence, which will eventually exhaust Calpheon’s financial system. Jordine persuaded Crucio that they must take this opportunity to collect more taxes to strengthen its military, while Crucio felt this to be the right time to rebuild Heidel Castle.

#5 Elionian Year 283
The peasants took up arms and rebelled--taxes didn't even change like this after a bad harvest! Barbarians had also recently grown violent and damaged many of the harvestable crops. After observing the changes in Calpheon, Al Rhundi went to the castle as a representative of the peasants. However, the lord forcibly imprisoned Al Rhundi and tortured him. After a few days in captivity, they released Al Rhundi at the Neutral Zone. The peasants were furious. However, they knew they could not fight head on with well-equipped, battle ready soldiers. The peasants fled en masse when they saw the soldiers, and others also refused to go back to their daily lives, including Al Rhundi. he eventually became the leader of the rebellion and had to hide in the Castle Ruins for protection. The situation worsened and Jordine found even more reason to increase taxes. However, the rebellion from the peasants was not the real reason Jordine decided to increase taxes again. A light from the sky fell to the ground that same year. Soon after that incident, enraged monsters appeared and went on a rampage among the barbarians. There were reports that rocks began to move as well. This was known as the Tower of Will incident.It’s been said that the ancients experienced a similar event when they initially built the Tower of Will.

#6 Elionian Year 285
According to the rumors, the number of outsiders increased greatly in Velia.

#1 Elionian Year 235
There was no exception. Even the nobles and the priests were forced to abandon their children. Those that lived outside the castle walls met a horrendous death. Their lifeless bodies were burned to prevent the spread of the disease. The pandemic that shook humanity to its core simply disappeared without a trace one day, but not before indiscriminately afflicting both nobles and commoners alike. This led the commoners to think they may actually be no different than the nobles. They prayed day and night in hopes of stopping this dreadful calamity, but Elion did not answer their prayers.The nobles that survived the calamity urgently called for other nobles to preserve their hierarchy in Calpheon. Elionian priests began spreading the lie that the Valencians were the heathens brought this disaster upon everyone, and that they used the black crystal within alchemy for these nefarious purposes. The kings added that the Black Desert must be conquered in order to stop any further catastrophe.

They made this promise to the lower class, who were starting to realize the value of the labor that they had been doing for free up until that point. An alliance was soon established, and this is how the long, bloody war between Calpheon and Valencia first started.

#1 Elionian Year 236
Dead bodies of the Valencians on the road seemed proof enough that disaster had swept across the land. Priests were ridiculed for their accusations and the reputation of the Elionian church began to crumble. But war was all the justification needed for revenge. Repeated expeditions have damaged Mediah. Mediah is located in the middle of the continent, accumulated wealth by providing supplies to the alliance. Swords and shields gave way to guns and cannons, increasing profit alongside the massive quarries that were then established. Knowledge was power.

Black crystals were needed to endure the harsh desert night. The alliance brought back massive amounts of black crystals every expedition, as if trying to rid the Black Desert of them completely. Mediah welcomed this. They informed the alliance that they needed black crystals to melt down and make gunpowder. This satisfied Calpheon, as they were able to cover some of their expenses of the expedition by supplying black crystals. Neither Valencia nor Calpheon knew the true value of those black crystals. While black crystals were being piled up, walled cities were being built in Mediah. Imur Nesser, the King of Valencia, became well-known during that time. First described as a devil who brought disaster, he later became known for mocking the alliance among the people, as Calpheon never once stepped foot in Valencia castle despite the many rebellions that occurred. The war raged on for 30 years until the last expedition, when the sand storm buried Calpheon's King Dahad and his forces beneath the sands of the great Black Desert.

#1 Elionian Year 267
The sandstorm kicked up again, having already wiped out the desert towns, while the tsunamis devoured all the ships anchored in the port towns. Highland earth was swept away by torrential rain, and typhoons transformed the map. In tropical areas beyond the deserts, severe droughts cracked the land. The Black Death had changed people, but natural disasters reshaped the world. The Fogans drove out the Naga and claimed the swamps as their territory.

The Orcs and Ogres migrated en masse in search of lands to settle. Groups of barbarians settled down in Southern Mediah, where they easily plundered anything they could reach, thanks to Mediah's crumbling kingdom. The chaos that ensued worldwide worsened survivors' already abysmal situation. Perhaps there would've been a better outcome if the people and barbarians understood each respective languages, but without this possibility, any hope of establishing a truce or sending an expedition into the country disappeared once the barbarians and people came into contact with each other.

#1 Elionian Year 275
Mediah served as a vital crossroad that allowed Keplan, Heidel and Oliva to trade with Valencia. As resources dwindled due to the ongoing war, there was no other option but to trade with Valencia. Calpheon eventually yielded to the proposals of the Elionin priests and allowed trading. Mediah drastically changed 10 years after the war. The barbarians occupied southern Mediah, and mysterious occupants in the strongholds in northern areas of Mediah were armed with cannons and rifles, looming over the merchants. Still, Mediah bustled with life and billows of smoke from happy homes stretched as far as eyes can see. One day, merchants of Calpheon started moving about the land, but nobody in Mediah knew why,for the answer lied in the sands of the Black Desert. The Valencian soldiers were deployed in the area, indicating that they were guarding something of high value or of great power.Despite this effort, Calpheon alchemists managed to get their hands on the black crystal. This would explain why the weapons crafted in Mediah became stronger. The magical crystals the priests spoke of were true after all. Eventually, the real worth of these magical stones spread all across Keplan, Heidel and Olvia.

Each country began their own search for the black crystals. Although Keplan was the first to discover the black crystals at the Rocky Mountain, they also found many with impurities. Mediah actually purchased a large number of these because of its superior composition quality and higher resistance to heat. However, Valencia eventually imposed trade restrictions on black crystals, forcing Mediah to search for alternatives.Black crystals were discovered in Serendia soon after--relatively small pebbles in the hands of the Naga. Mediah merchants traveled from afar to verify the purity of these pebbles. Calpheon grew restless and anxious with each passing day. They searched every inch of the kingdom, but to no avail. Calpheon feared that they would lose their influence without the black crystal and be relegated to a middle power. To prevent this, Calpheon turned their attention to the black crystals in Serendia. The citizens of Calpheon were exhausted from war and the frequent calamities that swept across the land. The leaders of Calpheon knew they would need a large fund in order to field a sizable, well equipped military.The young Calpheon king Guy Seric persuaded the Elonian Priests to fund the war as it’ll bring glory to Elion. In addition, Guy Seric promised to dispatch soldiers to aid the Calpheon merchants so that they can compete against the Serendian merchants. This war of greed followed shortly after.

#5 Elionian Year 276
Calpheon launched its Road to Serendia campaign and Keplan was the first city to incur its wrath. Now well-known figures such as Cliff and Armstrong took part in the great war in Heidel. Nobody was able to challenge the two generals that were deployed at Serendia watchtower. The Calpheon king, Guy Seric, sent 300 of his finest soldiers to Balenos. Heidel Castle was situated between the river that separated Balenos and Serendia. Calpheon soldiers used light, swift boats to quickly navigate through the river and launched a surprise attack on the unsuspecting Heidel soldiers. Upon receiving word on the surprise attack, Cliff and his soldiers rushed to repel the invaders, but by the time they reached the castle it had already been set ablaze. Guy Seric was not there.

#6 Elionian Year 277
The flames engulfing Heidel Castle was only the start of Calpheon’s attack. Calpheon had secured an early advantage by capturing Crucio, the king of Heidel. Guy Seric sent an emissary to Cliff with the promise that King Crucio would be released from captivity if three conditions were met. First, soldiers could not be deployed in large groups near the watchtower. Second, Serendia must concede its economic freedom to Calpheon. Finally, Serendia was to surrender all current and future black crystals to Calpheon.

#7 Elionian Year 278
King Crucio returned to Heidel after a year had passed. The war ended before it had even started. Olvia surrendered and was under direct control of Calpheon. Calpheon seized control of the mines in Keplan and constructed an extraction mill in Serendia to extract black crystals. Guy Seric was not satisfied with the current surplus and set his eyes to the Black Desert. Guy Seric was convinced no other powers would challenge Calpheon if it seized control of the Black Desert.

However, Guy Seric’s plan of dominance would only work with proper alliances. Guy Seric knew Heidel would not challenge Mediah and that the citizens of Heidel would not yield to his wishes. As a result, Guy Seric employed a large number of mercenaries and raised taxes to fund the war effort. This unpopular move caused an uproar among the common citizens. Due to growing backlash, Guy Seric had no choice but to request aid from the Church of Elion. The soldiers who were originally dispatched to the merchants returned to the king as well.

#8 Elionian Year 281
The king's ambitions wound up being nothing more than a mere dream. The fuedal system collapsed and commoners were now able to freely participate in various economic activities, opening an era of commerce and trading. Nobles, priests and commoners alike no longer based their actions on the king's decision. Reforms were made to the existing governmental system, and a council was established, with representatives from all classes taking part.

#1 Elionian Year 274
The king of Calpheon, Guy Seric, marveled at the sight of Kamasylvia and called it the "fortress protected by nature." The height of the large trees that covered Kamasylvia were greater than any seen before. It almost felt as if the large, tranquil trees were living and breathing. Kamasylvians were famous for mastery of the bow. Guy Seric saw this as an opportunity to bolster Calpheon's own bow mastery and sought to form a military alliance with Kamasylvia. Although hesitant at first, Kamasylvia agreed to Guy Seric’s persistent proposal. Kamasylvia sent its archers to the Anti-Troll Fortification and Saunil Fortress in the south. Nelydormin, the Elf Saint, led a group of priestesses to Longleaf Tree Sentry. To unwitting observers, it seemed Calpheon benefited most from this alliance. However, peacekeepers saught to hide the truth from outsiders that Kamasylvia and Grána were in the middle of a bloody civil war.

#2 Elionian Year 276
Brolina Ornette, who became a queen at a young age, did what she could to resolve growing tensions in Kamasylvia. She was born with strong Ganelle powers--both wise and with a strong spiritual connection to nature. The people of Kamasylvia praised her as a worthy queen. However, the ongoing war was a different story. The Ahib, one of the Vedir faction, constantly harassed Kamasylvia, something that greatly angered Brolina Ornette. Things were not always like this between the Ganelle and Vedir. The goddess Sylvia created Ganelle and Vedir from the energies of the sun and moon. However, the calamity that swept across the land in Elionian Year 235 put their bonds to the test. The descendants of Sylvia, who only sought a life of extravagance, experienced their first trial when the dark spirits invaded their lands, and their lives only worsened over time. The descendants of Sylvia could only rely on the power of the Kamasylve to survive. The ailing land cried out in pain to the descendants of Sylvia. Upon hearing the cries of the land, they prayed but the goddess did not answer them.

The Vedir searched for a source of power to repel the invaders. Unfortunately, the Vedir were unable to find a source of power greater than Kamasylve itself. One Vedir proposed burning the Kamasylve to harness its power. The power that came from burning the Kamasylve was powerful and destructive. But as this was done, the power of Kamasyvle became unstable. A great sense of loss resonated throughout the land when Kamasylve’s power began to fade away entirely. Fortunately, it was the song of the forest that woke Kamasylve from its slumber. The song of hope resonated throughout the forest for the first time in a very long while.

The black spirits that once ran amok disappeared from the land. However, the descendants of Sylvia were concerned they could no longer draw power from the goddess. To protect themselves in times of crisis, they used the power of Kamasylve to forge powerful weapons. The rangers, who were skilled with the bow and sword, created the Acher Guard, who took it upon themselves to protect Kamasylvia, preventing all outsiders from entering Kamasylvia. Since then, the Ganelle and Vedir continued to drift further apart. Although the source of power was the same, each faction wielded the power very differently. The Ahib rose to challenge the Ganelle. The Ahib were the factions of Vedir that relied on supernatural powers. Many say that Ahib came into existence during the time when the Vedir burned the Kamasylve for its power. The Ahib were arrogant and looked down on other factions. They went as far as to discredit the long history of the land. This led to Kamasylvia branding the Ahib as heretics. As a result, there was a sense of mistrust between the Vedir. Some declared their neutrality between the conservative Acher and the radical Ahib. The group of Vedir that declared neutrality possessed dark powers, unlike the Ganelle, but they still fully inherited the Kamasylvian rituals and were entrusted to protect Kamasylvia. The Acher, Ranger, Dark Knight and Ahib found it difficult to find a common ground.

The Ahib grew even more arrogant as time went by. There were rumors that the Ahib were involved in suspicious activity in Loopy Tree Forest and Kabua Mountain. The Acher Guard set up posts to closely monitor and prevent the Ahib from further entering their territory. The Dark Knights also opposed the Ahib, but the Ganelles grew even more resentful against the Vedir faction. They openly expressed their discontent towards the Vedir. The Acher were not afraid to wage war, while the Vedir faction knew they were greatly outnumbered and at a disadvantage, numbering just over half the total population of the Acher. As tensions escalated, the Dark Knights left Kamasylvia. On the day the Dark Knights disappeared from the history of Kamasylvia, the Acher moved against the Ahib, defeating them and forcing the Ahib to flee southeast. The Acher tried to exterminate the Ahib, but were forced to retreat at Ferocious Salun Bear's Realm.

It is said that the ferocious Salun Bear cannot be reasoned with. With their monstrous mass and eyes that glow in the dark, the Salun Bears are a terrifying sight. In spite of that, the Ahib were able to find a common understanding with the Salun Bear. The Acher had no choice but to retreat from the border of that barren land where thorny vines grew. The Acher focused on healing the ravaged lands that resulted from the frequent conflicts. They also needed to find a way to preserve the life force of Kamasylve. Some of the Vedir faction did not leave Kamasylvia. Some of them possessed Ganelle powers while others went so far as to seal their power as a sign of discontent with Vedir as a whole. Regardless, the Acher allowed them to stay in Kamasylvia.

#3 Elionian Year 283
Many in Kamasylvia rejoiced when mother nature recovered. The priestesses worked hard to harness sufficient energy to wake up Kamasylve from its deep sleep. Those among the priestesses who became Saints went beyond the borders of Kamasylvia and out to the world. They searched for energy that would wake up Kamasylve and finally begin to restore the Kamasylve’s energy.

#4 Elionian Year 284
8 years since the Ahib fled to the Arid Land... an Ahib stronghold arose in O'dyllita, a land shrouded in darkness, as rumors abound of a new weapon created from their alliance with the Salun Bears. The once dried-up thorn briars now bear murderous intent, as the barren soil now radiates with a crimson hue. In the northern plains of Kamasylvia, the Lemoria Guards kept a wary eye over the Ahib while bolstering their defenses. One day, the Lemoria Guards and Ahib from the Arid Land were caught in a skirmish at the Duzak Tunnel. The Lemoria Guards called for reinforcements, but the results were disastrous. They lost half their forces in the fight, which ended with the Kamasylve Priestesses sealing off the tunnel, as the Ahib withdrew. They were not the same Ahib as before. What did it take for them to become so strong? It was as frightful thought as meeting with the dark spirit. As the Ahib's reach continued to expand, the Achers grew restless. For the moment of the Kamasylve's restoration was ever so near. Yet with the current tide of the Ahib, peace may be a lost option...

#5 Elionian Year 286
Queen Brolina opened all the gates and roads coming into Kamasylvia. She sent out messengers to Calpheon and Drieghan.
